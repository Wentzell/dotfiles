  Abstract                 = {We study the Josephson current through a serial double quantum dot and the associated 0-π transitions which result from the subtle interplay between the superconductivity, the Kondo physics, and the interdot superexchange interaction. The competition between them is examined by tuning the relative strength Δ/TK of the superconducting gap and the Kondo temperature, for different strengths of the superexchange coupling determined by the interdot tunneling t relative to the level broadening Γ. We find strong renormalization of t, a significant role of the superexchange coupling J, and a rich phase diagram of the 0 and π-junction regimes. In particular, when both the superconductivity and the exchange interaction compete with the Kondo physics (Δ˜J˜TK), there appears an island of π' phase at large values of the superconducting phase difference.},

  Abstract                 = {Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor systems are interesting melting pots where various fundamental effects in condensed-matter physics coexist. For example, when a quantum dot is coupled to a superconducting electrode two very distinct phenomena, superconductivity and the Kondo effect, compete. As a result of this competition, the system undergoes a quantum phase transition when the superconducting gap Δ is of the order of the Kondo temperature TK. The underlying physics behind such transition ultimately relies on the physics of the Anderson model where the standard metallic host is replaced by a superconducting one, namely the physics of a (quantum) magnetic impurity in a superconductor. A characteristic feature of this hybrid system is the emergence of subgap bound states, the so-called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states, which cross zero energy across the quantum phase transition, signaling a switching of the fermion parity and spin (doublet or singlet) of the ground state. Interestingly, similar hybrid devices based on semiconducting nanowires with spin-orbit coupling may host exotic zero-energy bound states with Majorana character. Both parity crossings and Majorana bound states (MBSs) are experimentally marked by zero-bias anomalies in transport, which are detected by coupling the hybrid device with an extra normal contact. We here demonstrate theoretically that this extra contact, usually considered as a nonperturbing tunneling weak probe, leads to nontrivial effects. This conclusion is supported by numerical renormalization-group calculations of the phase diagram of an Anderson impurity coupled to both superconducting and normal-state leads. We obtain this phase diagram for an arbitrary ratio Δ/TK, which allows us to analyze relevant experimental scenarios, such as parity crossings as well as Kondo features induced by the normal lead, as this ratio changes. Spectral functions at finite temperatures and magnetic fields, which can be directly linked to experimental tunneling transport characteristics, show zero-energy anomalies irrespective of whether the system is in the doublet or singlet regime. We also derive the analytical condition for the occurrence of Zeeman-induced fermion-parity switches in the presence of interactions which bears unexpected similarities with the condition for emergent MBSs in nanowires.},

We use the Nambu formalism and the standard many-body diagrammatic representation of the impurity Green functions to formulate the Matsubara self-consistent perturbation expansion. We show that at zero temperature second order of the expansion in its spin-symmetric version yields a nearly perfect agreement with the numerically exact calculations for the position of the 0 - π phase boundary at which the Andreev bound states reach the Fermi energy as well as for the values of single-particle quantities in the 0-phase. We present results for phase diagrams, level occupation, induced local superconducting gap, Josephson current, and energy of the Andreev bound states with the precision surpassing any (semi)analytical approaches employed thus far.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an extensive experimental and theoretical study of the proximity effect in InAs nanowires connected to superconducting electrodes. We fabricate and investigate devices with suspended gate-controlled nanowires and nonsuspended nanowires, with a broad range of lengths and normal-state resistances. We analyze the main features of the current-voltage characteristics: the Josephson current, excess current, and subgap current as functions of length, temperature, magnetic field, and gate voltage, and compare them with theory. The Josephson critical current for a short-length device, L =30 nm, exhibits a record high magnitude of 800 nA at low temperature that comes close to the theoretically expected value. The critical current in all other devices is typically reduced compared to the theoretical values. The excess current is consistent with the normal resistance data and agrees well with the theory. The subgap current shows a large number of structures; some of them are identified as subharmonic gap structures generated by multiple Andreev reflection. The other structures, detected in both suspended and nonsuspended devices, have the form of voltage steps at voltages that are independent of either the superconducting gap or length of the wire. By varying the gate voltage in suspended devices, we are able to observe a crossover from typical tunneling transport at large negative gate voltage, with suppressed subgap current and negative excess current, to pronounced proximity junction behavior at large positive gate voltage, with enhanced Josephson current and subgap conductance as well as a large positive excess current.},

  Abstract                 = {Andreev scattering and the Josephson current through a one-dimensional interacting electron liquid sandwiched between two superconductors are reexamined. We first present some apparently new results on the noninteracting case by studying an exactly solvable tight-binding model rather than the usual continuum model. We show that perfect Andreev scattering (i.e., zero normal scattering) at the Fermi energy can only be achieved by fine-tuning junction parameters, a fine-tuning which is possible even with bandwidth mismatch between superconductor and normal metal. We also obtain exact results for the Josephson current, which is generally a smooth function of the superconducting phase difference except when the junction parameters are adjusted to give perfect Andreev scattering, in which case it becomes a sawtooth function. We then observe that, even when interactions are included, all low-energy properties of a junction (E<<Δ, the superconducting gap) can be obtained by ``integrating out'' the superconducting electrons to obtain an effective Hamiltonian describing the metallic electrons only with a boundary pairing interaction. This boundary model provides a suitable starting point for bosonization-renormalization group-boundary conformal field theory analysis. We argue that total normal reflection and total Andreev reflection correspond to two fixed points of the boundary renormalization group. For repulsive bulk interactions the Andreev fixed point is unstable and the normal one stable. However, the reverse is true for attractive interactions. This implies that a generic junction Hamiltonian (without fine-tuned junction parameters) will renormalize to the normal fixed point for repulsive interations but to the Andreev one for attractive interations. An exact mapping of our tight-binding model to the Hubbard model with a transverse magnetic field is used to help understand this behavior. We calculate the critical exponents, which are different at these two different fixed points.},

In these, the effect of spatially extended degrees of freedom is usually only taken into account in a mean field fashion or as a secondary effect. As a result, critical exponents associated with phase transitions have a mean field character. Here we demonstrate that diagrammatic multiscale methods anchored around local approximations are indeed capable of capturing the non-mean-field nature of the critical point of the lattice model encoded in a nonvanishing anomalous dimension and of correctly describing the transition to mean-field-like behavior as the number of spatial dimensions increases.},

We show that an l-orbital model with the most general interaction is described within this approximation by 4l2×4l2 matrices and is Fermi liquid in the metallic phase. We explicitly calculate properties of a paramagnetic solution of a two-orbital Hubbard model with a Hund exchange and orbital splitting within the dynamical mean-field approximation.

  Abstract                 = {The measurement of phase in coherent electron systems-that is, `mesoscopic' systems such as quantum dots-can yield information about fundamental transport properties that is not readily apparent from conductance measurements. Phase measurements on relatively large quantum dots recently revealed that the phase evolution for electrons traversing the dots exhibits a `universal' behaviour, independent of dot size, shape, and electron occupancy. Specifically, for quantum dots in the Coulomb blockade regime, the transmission phase increases monotonically by π throughout each conductance peak; in the conductance valleys, the phase returns sharply to its starting value. The expected mesoscopic features in the phase evolution-related to the dot's shape, spin degeneracy or to exchange effects-have not been observed, and there is at present no satisfactory explanation for the observed universality in phase behaviour. Here we report the results of phase measurements on a series of small quantum dots, having occupancies of between only 1-20 electrons, where the phase behaviour for electron transmission should in principle be easier to interpret. In contrast to the universal behaviour observed thus far only in the larger dots, we see clear mesoscopic features in the phase measurements when the dot occupancy is less than ~10 electrons. As the occupancy increases, the manner of phase evolution changes and universal behaviour is recovered for some 14 electrons or more. The identification of a transition from the expected mesoscopic behaviour to universal phase evolution should help to direct and constrain theoretical models for the latter.},

A general path-integral formalism is developed and the response of SAN and SAS junctions to a constant voltage bias V is elucidated, using a combination of the Keldysh technique (to handle nonequilibrium effects) and a dynamical mean-field approximation (to handle repulsive Hubbard interactions). An interesting physics is exposed at subgap voltages (eV<Δ for SAN and eV<2Δ for SAS). For an SAN junction, Andreev reflection is strongly affected by Coulomb interaction. For superconductors with p-wave symmetry the junction conductance exhibits a remarkable peak at eV<Δ, while for superconductors with s-wave symmetric pair potential the peak is shifted towards the gap edge eV=Δ and strongly suppressed if the Hubbard repulsive interaction increases. Electron transport in SAS junctions is determined by an interplay between multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) and Coulomb effects. For s-wave superconductors the usual peaks in the conductance that originate from MAR are shifted by interaction to larger values of V. They are also suppressed as the Hubbard interaction strength grows. For p-wave superconductors the subgap current is much larger and the I-V characteristics reveal an interesting feature, namely, a peak in the current resulting from a midgap bound state in the junction.},

It is an atomic-limit approximation of a functional of the one- and two-particle Green functions, built with the second Legendre transform of the free energy with respect to the two-particle Green function. This functional is represented diagrammatically by four-particle irreducible (4PI) diagrams. Like the dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A), the fully irreducible vertex is computed from a quantum impurity model whose bath is self-consistently determined by solving the parquet equations. However, in contrast with D$\Gamma$A and DMFT, the interaction term of the impurity model is also self-consistently determined. The method interpolates between the parquet approximation at weak coupling and the atomic limit, where it is exact. It is applicable to systems with short-range and long-range interactions.},

This vertex is self-consistently computed using a quantum impurity model with dynamical interactions in the charge and spin channels, similar to dynamical mean field theory approaches. The electronic self-energy and the polarization are both frequency and momentum dependent. The method interpolates between the spin-fluctuation or GW approximations at weak coupling and the atomic limit at strong coupling. We apply the formalism to the Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice and show that as interactions are increased towards the Mott insulating state, the local vertex acquires a strong frequency dependence, driving the system to a Mott transition, while at low enough temperatures the momentum dependence of the self-energy is enhanced due to large spin fluctuations. Upon doping, we find a Fermi arc in the one-particle spectral function, which is one signature of the pseudogap state.},

  Abstract                 = {This review presents recent developments in the understanding of how impurities influence the electronic states in the bulk properties of superconductors. The focus is on quasilocalized states in the vicinity of impurity sites in conventional and unconventional superconductors and the goal is to provide a unified framework for their description. The nonmagnetic impurity resonances in unconventional superconductors are directly related to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states around magnetic impurities in conventional s -wave systems. The physics behind these states, including the quantum phase transition between screened and unscreened impurities, are reviewed and recent work on d -wave superconductors is emphasized. The bound states are seen in scanning-tunneling spectroscopy measurements on high- Tc cuprates, which are described in detail. This paper discusses very recent progress in our understanding of states coupled to impurity sites, which have their own dynamics. Also reviewed are inelastic electron-tunneling spectroscopy features that could be seen by scanning-tunneling microscopy in real space and their Fourier-transformed images and impurity resonances in the presence of an order competing with superconductivity. The last part of the review is devoted to the influence of local deviations of the impurity concentration from its average value on the density of states in s -wave superconductors. Discussed is how these fluctuations affect the density of states and it is shown that s -wave superconductors are, strictly speaking, gapless in the presence of an arbitrarily small concentration of magnetic impurities.},

  Abstract                 = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ℏω. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (ℏω)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5kTc at T=0°K to zero at Tc. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

Our method is based on a generalization of a method proposed by Sch{\"u}tz et al (2005 Phys. Rev. B 72 035107), using two independent Hubbard-Stratonovich fields associated with transverse and longitudinal spin fluctuations. Although we do not reproduce the exponentially small Kondo scale in the limit U \rightarrow \infty , the spin fluctuations included in our approach remove the unphysical Stoner instability predicted by mean field theory for U>πΔ. We discuss different decoupling schemes and show that a decoupling which manifestly respects the spin-rotational invariance of the problem gives rise to the lowest quasiparticle weight. To obtain a closed flow equation for the fermionic self-energy we also propose a new scheme of truncation of the functional renormalization group flow equations using Dyson-Schwinger equations to express bosonic vertex functions in terms of fermionic ones.},

  Abstract                 = {When two superconductors are connected by a weak link, a supercurrent flows, the magnitude of which is determined by the difference in the macroscopic quantum phases of the superconductors. This phenomenon was discovered by Josephson for the case of a weak link formed by a thin tunnel barrier: the supercurrent, I, is related to the phase difference, π, through the Josephson current-phase relation, I = Icsinπ, with Ic being the critical current which depends on the properties of the weak link. A similar relation holds for weak links consisting of a normal metal, a semiconductor or a constriction. In all cases, the phase difference is zero when no supercurrent flows through the junction, and increases monotonically with increasing supercurrent until the critical current is reached. Here we use nanolithography techniques to fabricate a Josephson junction with a normal-metal weak link in which we have direct access to the microscopic current-carrying electronic states inside the link. We find that the fundamental Josephson relation can be changed from I = Icsinπ to I = Icsin(π + π)-that is, a π-junction-by controlling the energy distribution of the current-carrying states in the normal metal. This fundamental change in the way these Josephson junctions behave has potential implications for their use in superconducting electronics as well as in (quantum) logic circuits based on superconductors.},

We demonstrate that an effective one-channel Anderson impurity model with a sizable particle-hole asymmetry captures universal and nonuniversal observations in the system quantitatively.

The dependence Ic(Vg) shows resonant singularities and has a qualitatively different character for Δ<EC and Δ>EC, Δ being the superconducting gap and EC=e2/2C being the charging energy. Due to the sweeping of the gate voltage, the system can be driven to states which are metastable with respect to a change of the number of electrons on the central island. Since the lifetime of the metastable states can be macroscopically large, one can observe a remarkable bistability of the Josephson current. A weak magnetic field suppresses the interference of the electrons propagating through the central electrode, and, consequently, the magnitude of the critical current.},

In addition to the possible phase transition to a π state, already present in the single dot case, this system exhibits a richer magnetic behavior due to the competition between Kondo and interdot antiferromagnetic coupling. We obtain results for the Josephson current which may help to understand recent experiments on superconductor-metallofullerene dimer junctions. We show that in such a system the Josephson effect can be used to control its magnetic configuration.},

  Abstract                 = {We review the use of an exact renormalization group equation in quantum field theory and statistical physics. It describes the dependence of the free energy on an infrared cutoff for the quantum or thermal fluctuations. Non-perturbative solutions follow from approximations to the general form of the coarse-grained free energy or effective average action. They interpolate between the microphysical laws and the complex macroscopic phenomena. Our approach yields a simple unified description for O( N)-symmetric scalar models in two, three or four dimensions, covering in particular the critical phenomena for the second-order phase transitions, including the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and the critical behavior of polymer chains. We compute the aspects of the critical equation of state which are universal for a large variety of physical systems and establish a direct connection between microphysical and critical quantities for a liquid-gas transition. Universal features of first-order phase transitions are studied in the context of scalar matrix models. We show that the quantitative treatment of coarse graining is essential for a detailed estimate of the nucleation rate. We discuss quantum statistics in thermal equilibrium or thermal quantum field theory with fermions and bosons and we describe the high-temperature symmetry restoration in quantum field theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we explore chiral symmetry breaking and the high-temperature or high-density chiral phase transition in quantum chromodynamics using models with effective four-fermion interactions.},

Next, the functional renormalization-group method is used to capture correlation effects induced by the Coulomb interaction. For short wires we show that the energy regime in which spin polarization is found is strongly affected by the Coulomb interaction. For long wires we find the power-law suppression of the total conductance on low-energy scales typical for inhomogeneous Luttinger liquids while the degree of spin polarization stays constant.},

  Abstract                 = {Strong repulsive interactions within a one-dimensional Fermi system in a two-probe configuration normally lead to a reduced off-resonance conductance. We show that if the repulsive interaction extends to the contact regions, a strong increase of the conductance may occur, even for systems where one would expect to find a reduced conductance. An essential ingredient in our calculations is a momentum-space representation of the leads, which allows a high energy resolution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these results are independent of the high-energy cutoff and that the relevant scale is set by the Fermi velocity.},

The Coulomb interaction acts between the electron on the impurity and in the different channels. In the case of a repulsive or attractive interaction the conduction electrons are pushed away or attracted to ease or hinder the hopping by creating unoccupied or occupied states, respectively. In the screening of the hopping orthogonality catastrophe plays an important role. At equilibrium in the weak- and strong-coupling limits the renormalizations are treated by perturbative, numerical, and Anderson-Yuval Coulomb gas methods. In the case of two leads the current due to applied voltage is treated in the weak-coupling limit. The presented detailed study should help to test other methods suggested for nonequilibrium transport.},

This facilitates the calculation of the susceptibility in strongly correlated systems where long-ranged nonlocal correlations cannot be neglected. We formulate the Bethe-Salpeter equations for the full vertex in the particle-particle and particle-hole channels and introduce an approximation for practical calculations. The scheme is applied to the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling. The spin-spin susceptibility is found to strongly increase for the wave vector q=(π,π) , which indicates the antiferromagnetic instability. We find a suppression of the critical temperature compared to the mean-field result due to the incorporation of the nonlocal spin fluctuations.},

It is the basis for a variety of circuits and devices, with applications ranging from medicine to quantum information. Experiments using Josephson circuits that behave like artificial atoms are now revolutionizing the way we probe and exploit the laws of quantum physics. Microscopically, the supercurrent is carried by Andreev pair states, which are localized at the weak link. These states come in doublets and have energies inside the superconducting gap. Existing Josephson circuits are based on properties of just the ground state of each doublet, and so far the excited states have not been directly detected. Here we establish their existence through spectroscopic measurements of superconducting atomic contacts. The spectra, which depend on the atomic configuration and on the phase difference between the superconductors, are in complete agreement with theory. Andreev doublets could be exploited to encode information in novel types of superconducting qubits.},

Quasiparticle excitations are induced by a broadband on-chip microwave source and detected by measuring changes in the supercurrent flowing through the atomic contact. Since microwave photons excite quasiparticles in pairs, two types of transitions are observed: Andreev transitions, which consist of putting two quasiparticles in an Andreev level, and transitions to odd states with a single quasiparticle in an Andreev level and the other one in the continuum. In contrast to absorption spectroscopy, supercurrent spectroscopy allows detection of long-lived odd states.},

We determine the conditions for observing a finite anomalous supercurrent Ia=I(φ=0). For a two-level dot with spin-orbit coupling and arbitrarily weak Zeeman field B, we find the onset behavior Ia∝sgn(B) in the presence of interactions, suggesting the incipient spontaneous breakdown of time-reversal symmetry. We also provide conditions for realizing spatially separated (but topologically unprotected) Majorana bound states in a double dot variant of this system.

When applied to the Kondo problem, this numerical renormalization group (NRG) method gave for the first time the full crossover from the high-temperature phase of a free spin to the low-temperature phase of a completely screened spin. The NRG method was later generalized to a variety of quantum impurity problems. The purpose of this review is to give a brief introduction to the NRG method, including some guidelines for calculating physical quantities, and to survey the development of the NRG method and its various applications over the last 30 years. These applications include variants of the original Kondo problem such as the non-Fermi-liquid behavior in the two-channel Kondo model, dissipative quantum systems such as the spin-boson model, and lattice systems in the framework of the dynamical mean-field theory.},

  Abstract                 = {A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) with single-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) Josephson junctions is presented. Quantum confinement in each junction induces a discrete quantum dot (QD) energy level structure, which can be controlled with two lateral electrostatic gates. In addition, a backgate electrode can vary the transparency of the QD barriers, thus permitting change in the hybridization of the QD states with the superconducting contacts. The gates are also used to directly tune the quantum phase interference of the Cooper pairs circulating in the SQUID ring. Optimal modulation of the switching current with magnetic flux is achieved when both QD junctions are in the `on' or `off' state. In particular, the SQUID design establishes that these CNT Josephson junctions can be used as gate-controlled π-junctions that is, the sign of the current-phase relation across the CNT junctions can be tuned with a gate voltage. The CNT-SQUIDs are sensitive local magnetometers, which are very promising for the study of magnetization reversal of an individual magnetic particle or molecule placed on one of the two CNT Josephson junctions.},

We calculate the noise exactly in the limit of no on-site Coulomb repulsion. Our result reveals a noise spectrum that is dramatically different from the usual Lorentzian assumed in simple models. We show that the noise is dominated by sharp subgap resonances associated to the formation of pairs of Andreev bound states, thus providing a possible explanation for the spurious two-level systems (microresonators) observed in Josephson-junction qubits [R. W. Simmonds , Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 077003 (2004).]. Another implication of our model is that each trapping center will contribute a sharp dielectric resonance only in the superconducting phase, providing an effective way to validate our results experimentally. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for a qubit interacting with Andreev bound states, establishing a direct connection between phenomenological models and the microscopic parameters of a Fermionic bath.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the problem of transport through two quantum dots coupled via a finite-length quantum wire. In the limit where each dot acts essentially as a localized Kondo impurity, the geometry allows us to study various questions in the many-impurity problem like the interplay of Kondo and RKKY interactions, the average interimpurity distance beyond which the single-impurity model becomes valid, etc. We model the system in terms of the two-impurity Anderson model and study the transport behavior using a perturbative (in the Coulomb interaction U ) approach, restricting ourselves to the ``symmetric'' case. It can be seen that (antiferromagnetic) ferromagnetic correlations develop between the impurities for (``odd'') ``even'' distances between the impurities. We analyze the antiferromagnetic case in detail and show that the linear conductance for the coupled dot system has a nonmonotonic temperature dependence in contrast to the monotonic temperature dependence for the single-dot system. A temperature scale emerges in the problem---the coherence temperature---below which the two impurities develop strong correlations. The emergence of this scale is also reflected in the behavior of the impurity Green functions. In particular, the zero-temperature diagonal impurity density of states shows a splitting of the Kondo resonance with the splitting width being of the same order as the coherence temperature. The coherence temperature decreases with an increase in the distance between the impurities and increases with an increase in U . Finally, we also study transport in the ``side'' geometry where the dots are side coupled to a long wire at a finite distance and show that essentially the same physics is observed for the antiferromagnetic case as in the ``chain'' geometry.},

The method treats single-particle and collective excitations in all channels on equal footing, allows for the description of symmetry breaking and captures collective mode fluctuation physics in the infrared. As a first application, we study the superfluid ground state of the two-dimensional attractive Hubbard model. We obtain superfluid gaps that are reduced by fluctuations in comparison to the one-loop approximation and demonstrate that the method captures the renormalization of the amplitude mode by long-range phase fluctuations.},

We focus on the parameter regime in which transport is dominated by Kondo physics. A sizeable supercurrent is observed for odd number of electrons on the nanotube when the Kondo temperature TK is sufficiently large compared to the superconducting gap. On the other hand when, in the center of the Kondo ridge, TK is slightly smaller than the superconducting gap, the supercurrent is found to be extremely sensitive to the gate voltage VBG . Whereas it is largely suppressed at the center of the ridge, it shows a sharp increase at a finite value of VBG . This increase can be attributed to a doublet-singlet transition of the spin state of the nanotube island leading to a π shift in the current phase relation. This transition is very sensitive to the asymmetry of the contacts and is in good agreement with theoretical predictions.},

Whereas the enhanced differential conductance dI/dV due to the Kondo resonance is observed in the normal state, this feature around zero-bias voltage is absent in the superconducting state. Nonetheless, a pronounced even-odd effect appears at finite bias in the dI/dV subgap structure caused by Andreev reflection. The first-order Andreev peak appearing around V=Δ/e is markedly enhanced in gate-voltage regions, in which the charge state of the quantum dot is odd. This enhancement is explained by a ``hidden'' Kondo resonance, pinned to one contact only. A comparison with a single-impurity Anderson model, which is solved numerically in a slave-boson mean-field approach, yields good agreement with the experiment.},

We find that the I-V characteristics are strongly asymmetric: for a large bias voltage of certain polarity, transport is blocked by populating the double dot with states whose spin symmetry is incompatible with the superconductor. Furthermore, by tuning gate voltages one has access to splitting of the Andreev excitation energies, which is visible in the differential conductance.},

The use of a two-body basis set indexed by relative separation, rather than relative momentum, is emphasized. The fluctuation-exchange approximation for the three-orbital CuO2 model with on-site and near-neighbor Coulomb interactions is solved for one-particle properties. Unit-cell densities corresponding to both ``hole doping'' and ``electron doping'' are studied. The model is found to be far from a charge-density instability for all reasonable parameter values. The only nearly unstable particle-hole channel for unit-cell densities close to unity has Q~(π,π) and S=1 (antiferromagnetic). The Fermi surface of the interacting system is computed, and the Luttinger theorem verified numerically in its most general context. Orbital-projected occupancy factors and spectral densities are examined.},

Local spectroscopy at 4.5 kelvin shows that the spin-1 system formed by manganese-phthalocyanine (MnPc) adsorbed on Pb(111) can lie in two different magnetic ground states. These are determined by the balance between Kondo screening and superconducting pair-breaking interactions. Both ground states alternate at nanometer length scales to form a Moiré-like superstructure. The quantum phase transition connecting the two (singlet and doublet) ground states is thus tuned by small changes in the molecule-lead interaction.},

These are also compared to analytical results obtained from the LMA as implemented in practice. Very good agreement between the two is found, essentially on all relevant energy scales from the high-energy Hubbard satellites to the low-energy Kondo resonance.},

This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed.

At Van Hove filling, we find that the Fermi-surface deformations remain small at fixed particle density and have a minor impact on the structure of the interaction vertex. The frequency dependence of the self-energy, however, turns out to be important, especially at a transition from ferromagnetism to d-wave superconductivity.

  Abstract                 = {How localized electrons interact with delocalized electrons is a central question to many problems in sold-state physics. The simplest manifestation of this situation is the Kondo effect, which occurs when an impurity atom with an unpaired electron is placed in a metal. At low temperatures a spin singlet state is formed between the unpaired localized electron and delocalized electrons at the Fermi energy. Theories predict that a Kondo singlet should form in a single-electron transistor (SET), which contains a confined `droplet' of electrons coupled by quantum-mechanical tunnelling to the delocalized electrons in the transistor's leads. If this is so, a SET could provide a means of investigating aspects of the Kondo effect under controlled circumstances that are not accessible in conventional systems: the number of electrons can be changed from odd to even, the difference in energy between the localized state and the Fermi level can be tuned, the coupling to the leads can be adjusted, voltage differences can be applied to reveal non-equilibrium Kondo phenomena, and a single localized state can be studied rather than a statistical distribution. But for SETs fabricated previously, the binding energy of the spin singlet has been too small to observe Kondo phenomena. Ralph and Buhrman have observed the Kondo singlet at a single accidental impurity in a metal point contact, but with only two electrodes and without control over the structure they were not able to observe all of the features predicted. Here we report measurements on SETs smaller than those made previously, which exhibit all of the predicted aspects of the Kondo effect in such a system.},

The linear conductance as a function of a gate voltage Vg equally shifting the levels on both dots shows two B=0 Kondo ridges, which are robust against SOI as time-reversal symmetry is preserved. As a result of the crossing of a spin-up and a spin-down level at vanishing SOI, two additional Kondo plateaus appear at finite B. They are not protected by symmetry and rapidly vanish if the SOI is turned on. Left-right asymmetric level-lead couplings and detuned on-site energies lead to a simultaneous breaking of left-right and bonding-antibonding state symmetry. In this case, the finite-B Kondo ridges in the Vg-B plane are bent with respect to the Vg axis. For the Kondo ridge to develop, different level renormalizations must be compensated by adjusting B.},

While dynamical mean-field theory provides a good approximation for the local part of the self-energy, including its frequency dependence, the partial summation of bubble and/or ladder diagrams typically yields worse results than second-order perturbation theory. Even widely used self-consistent schemes such as G W or the fluctuation-exchange approximation (FLEX) are found to be unreliable. Combining the dynamical mean-field self-energy with the nonlocal component of G W in G W + DMFT yields improved results for the local self-energy and nonlocal self-energies of the correct order of magnitude, but here, too, a more reliable scheme is obtained by restricting the nonlocal contribution to the second-order diagram. FLEX + DMFT is found to give accurate results in the low-density regime, but even worse results than FLEX near half-filling.},

We illustrate our method by examining the attractive and repulsive Hubbard model in two dimensions. In the latter, spin fluctuations are identified as the origin of the pseudogap, and we also explain why d -wave pairing fluctuations play a marginal role in suppressing the low-energy spectral weight, independent of their actual strength.},

We summarize experimental and theoretical work devoted to the phase of the transmission amplitude. It is shown that the evolution of the transmission phase may be dominated by non-universal features in the short-time dynamics of the quantum dot. The controlled dephasing in Coulomb-coupled conductors is investigated. Examples comprise a single or multiple quantum dots in close vicinity to a quantum point contact. The current through the quantum point contact ``measures'' the state of the dots and causes dephasing. The dephasing rate is derived using widely different theoretical approaches.

Good agreement with numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo results is found for a single bath site over a wide range of parameters. In particular, the Kondo resonance in the intermediate-coupling regime is well reproduced for a single bath site and the lowest-order correction. The method is particularly suited for low temperatures, alleviates analytical continuation of imaginary time data due to the absence of statistical noise and can be generalized to obtain dynamical quantities directly on the real axis.},

The new technique is applied to the two-dimensional Hubbard model. We demonstrate that the transformed perturbation series for the nonlocal dual fermions has superior convergence properties over standard diagrammatic techniques. The critical Néel temperature of the mean-field solution is suppressed in the ladder approximation, in accordance with quantum Monte Carlo results. An illustration of how the approach captures and allows us to distinguish short- and long-range correlations is given.},

Short-range correlations are treated exactly using a dynamical cluster approximation quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, while longer-length-scale physics requiring larger cluster sizes is incorporated through the introduction of the fluctuation-exchange approximation. The properties of the resulting hybrid scheme are examined and the description of local-moment formation is compared to exact results in one dimension (1D). The effects of electron-electron coupling and electron doping on the shape of the Fermi surface are demonstrated in 2D. Causality is examined in both 1D and 2D. We find that the scheme is successful if QMC clusters of NC⩾4 are used (with sufficiently high temperatures in 1D), however, very small QMC clusters of NC=1 lead to acausal results.},

This requires an infinite summation of skeleton diagrams in the generating functional thus defining the ``symmetrized finite-U NCA'' (SUNCA).

We discuss as case studies the anharmonic oscillator and the single-impurity Anderson model. We truncate the hierarchy of flow equations such that the results are at least correct up to second-order perturbation theory in the coupling. For the anharmonic oscillator, energies and spectra obtained within two different functional renormalization group schemes are compared to numerically exact results, perturbation theory results, and the mean field approximation. Even at large coupling, the results obtained using the functional renormalization group agree quite well with the numerical exact solution. The better of the two schemes is used to calculate spectra of the single-impurity Anderson model, which are then compared to the results from perturbation theory and the numerical renormalization group ones. For small to intermediate couplings the functional renormalization group gives results which are close to the ones obtained using the very accurate numerical renormalization group method. In particular, the low energy scale (Kondo temperature) extracted from the functional renormalization group results shows the expected behaviour.},

The dynamical mean-field approximation (exact result) is obtained by taking the cluster to a single site (the thermodynamic limit). Here, we provide details of our method, explicitly show that it is causal, systematic, Φ derivable, and that it becomes conserving as the cluster size increases. We demonstrate the DCA by applying it to a quantum Monte Carlo and exact enumeration study of the two-dimensional Falicov-Kimball model. The resulting spectral functions preserve causality, and the spectra and the charge-density-wave transition temperature converge quickly and systematically to the thermodynamic limit as the cluster size increases.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-locality is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics that manifests itself as correlations between spatially separated parts of a quantum system. A fundamental route for the exploration of such phenomena is the generation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs of quantum-entangled objects for the test of so-called Bell inequalities. Whereas such experimental tests of non-locality have been successfully conducted with pairwise entangled photons, it has not yet been possible to realize an electronic analogue of it in the solid state, where spin-1/2 mobile electrons are the natural quantum objects. The difficulty stems from the fact that electrons are immersed in a macroscopic ground state-the Fermi sea-which prevents the straightforward generation and splitting of entangled pairs of electrons on demand. A superconductor, however, could act as a source of EPR pairs of electrons, because its ground-state is composed of Cooper pairs in a spin-singlet state. These Cooper pairs can be extracted from a superconductor by tunnelling, but, to obtain an efficient EPR source of entangled electrons, the splitting of the Cooper pairs into separate electrons has to be enforced. This can be achieved by having the electrons `repel' each other by Coulomb interaction. Controlled Cooper pair splitting can thereby be realized by coupling of the superconductor to two normal metal drain contacts by means of individually tunable quantum dots. Here we demonstrate the first experimental realization of such a tunable Cooper pair splitter, which shows a surprisingly high efficiency. Our findings open a route towards a first test of the EPR paradox and Bell inequalities in the solid state.},

Our method allows us to analyze the competition between superconducting and various magnetic Fermi surface instabilities in the one-loop approximation. In particular, this includes ferromagnetic fluctuations, which are difficult to treat on an equal footing in conventional Wilsonian momentum space techniques. Applying the scheme to the two-dimensional t-t' Hubbard model we investigate the RG flow of the interactions at the van Hove filling with varying next-nearest-neighbor hopping t'. Starting at t'=0 we describe the evolution of the flow to strong coupling from an antiferromagnetic nesting regime over a d-wave regime at moderate t' to a ferromagnetic region at larger absolute values of t'. Upon increasing the particle density in the latter regime the ferromagnetic tendencies are cut off and the leading instability occurs in the triplet superconducting pairing channel.},

The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit.

  Abstract                 = {Metal-insulator transitions are accompanied by huge resistivity changes, even over tens of orders of magnitude, and are widely observed in condensed-matter systems. This article presents the observations and current understanding of the metal-insulator transition with a pedagogical introduction to the subject. Especially important are the transitions driven by correlation effects associated with the electron-electron interaction. The insulating phase caused by the correlation effects is categorized as the Mott Insulator. Near the transition point the metallic state shows fluctuations and orderings in the spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom. The properties of these metals are frequently quite different from those of ordinary metals, as measured by transport, optical, and magnetic probes. The review first describes theoretical approaches to the unusual metallic states and to the metal-insulator transition. The Fermi-liquid theory treats the correlations that can be adiabatically connected with the noninteracting picture. Strong-coupling models that do not require Fermi-liquid behavior have also been developed. Much work has also been done on the scaling theory of the transition. A central issue for this review is the evaluation of these approaches in simple theoretical systems such as the Hubbard model and t-J models. Another key issue is strong competition among various orderings as in the interplay of spin and orbital fluctuations. Experimentally, the unusual properties of the metallic state near the insulating transition have been most extensively studied in d-electron systems. In particular, there is revived interest in transition-metal oxides, motivated by the epoch-making findings of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates and colossal magnetoresistance in manganites. The article reviews the rich phenomena of anomalous metallicity, taking as examples Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Ru compounds. The diverse phenomena include strong spin and orbital fluctuations, mass renormalization effects, incoherence of charge dynamics, and phase transitions under control of key parameters such as band filling, bandwidth, and dimensionality. These parameters are experimentally varied by doping, pressure, chemical composition, and magnetic fields. Much of the observed behavior can be described by the current theory. Open questions and future problems are also extracted from comparison between experimental results and theoretical achievements.},

The reported semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes have normal state differential conductance up to 3e2/h and exhibit clear Fabry-Perot interference patterns in the bias spectroscopy plot. We observed subharmonic gap structure in the differential conductance and a distinct peak in the conductance at zero bias, which is interpreted as a manifestation of the supercurrent. The gate dependence of this supercurrent as well as the excess current are examined and compared to the coherent theory of superconducting quantum point contacts with good agreement.},

We present how the level broadening Γ/2 can be used as flow parameter for the fRG. This choice preserves important aspects of the Fermi-liquid behavior that the model exhibits in case of particle-hole symmetry. An approximation scheme for the Keldysh fRG is developed which accounts for the frequency dependence of the two-particle vertex in a way similar but not equivalent to a recently published approximation to the equilibrium Matsubara fRG. Our method turns out to be a flexible tool for the study of weak to intermediate on-site interactions U≲3Γ . In equilibrium we find excellent agreement with numerical RG results for the linear conductance at finite gate voltage, magnetic field, and temperature. In nonequilibrium, our results for the current agree well with time-dependent density-matrix RG. For the nonlinear conductance as function of the bias voltage, we propose reliable results at finite magnetic field and finite temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate the exponentially small scale of the Kondo temperature to appear in the second-order derivative of the self-energy. We show that the approximation is, however, not able to reproduce the scaling of the effective mass at large interactions.},

To obtain a consistent description of one- and two-particle quantities, needed for the stability analysis, we use explicit equations for one- and two-particle Green functions simultaneously. We formulate a complete set of stability criteria and show that each instability, singularity in a two-particle function, is connected with a symmetry-breaking order parameter, either of density or anomalous type. We explicitly study the Hubbard model at intermediate coupling and demonstrate that approximations with static vertices become unstable with respect to spin flips, before the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition in the paramagnetic phase or the Kondo strong-coupling regime can be reached. Further on, we use the parquet approximation and turn it into a workable scheme with dynamical vertex corrections. We obtain a theory with two-particle self-consistence, the complexity of which is comparable with fluctuation-exchange-type approximations. We show that it is the simplest consistent theory free of spurious phases being able to correctly describe qualitatively, quantum critical points and the transition from weak to strong coupling in correlated electron systems.},

We argue that with increasing interaction a pole in a generic two-particle Green function is approached. The pole signals condensation of electron-hole pairs and a metal-insulator transition at half-filling. The two-particle singularity calls for a sophisticated renormalization of the interaction strength. A self-consistent diagrammatic technique with renormalized two-particle Green functions is developed. The theory is based on a linked-cluster expansion for the thermodynamic potential with electron-electron interaction as the propagator. The simplest theory with full vertex renormalization, summing self-consistently multiple scatterings from two electron-hole channels, is proposed. We obtain an approximation with a generating functional in closed form enabling us to handle appropriately singularities in two-particle Green functions. The approximation is shown to be asymptotically exact in an external magnetic field close to the fully polarized ferromagnetic state at half-filling and zero temperature.},

In analogy with many-body theory we construct parquet equations for topologically distinct nonlocal irreducible vertex functions into which the local one-particle propagator and two-particle vertex of the coherent-potential approximation (CPA) enter as input. To complete the two-particle parquet equations we use an integral form of the Ward identity and determine the one-particle self-energy from the known irreducible vertex. In this way a conserving approximation with (Herglotz) analytic averaged Green functions is obtained. We use the limit of high spatial dimensions to demonstrate how nonlocal corrections to the d=∞ (CPA) solution emerge. The general parquet construction is applied to the calculation of vertex corrections to the electrical conductivity. With the aid of the high-dimensional asymptotics of the nonlocal irreducible vertex in the electron-hole scattering channel we derive a mean-field approximation for the conductivity with vertex corrections. The impact of vertex corrections onto the electronic transport is assessed quantitatively within the proposed mean-field description on a binary alloy.},

  Abstract                 = {The Anderson model of noninteracting disordered electrons is studied in high spatial dimensions. We find that off-diagonal one- and two-particle propagators behave as Gaussian random variables with respect to momentum summations. With this simplification and with the electron-hole symmetry we reduce the parquet equations for two-particle irreducible vertices to a single algebraic equation for a local vertex. We find a disorder-driven bifurcation point in this equation signaling vanishing of diffusion and onset of Anderson localization. There is no bifurcation in d=1,2 where all states are localized. A natural order parameter for Anderson localization emerges from the construction.},

We set general conditions for the existence of a critical metal-insulator transition caused by a divergence of the imaginary part of the self-energy. We calculate explicitly the critical behavior of the self-energy for the symmetric and asymmetric disorder distributions. We demonstrate that the metal-insulator transition is preceded by a pole in a two-particle irreducible vertex. We show that unlike the singularity in the self-energy the divergence in the irreducible vertex does not lead to nonanalyticities in measurable physical quantities. We reveal universal features of the critical metal-insulator transition that are transferable also to the Mott-Hubbard transition in the models of the local Fermi liquid.},

  Abstract                 = {Electronic transport through nanostructures is greatly affected by the presence of superconducting leads. If the interface between the nanostructure and the superconductors is sufficiently transparent, a dissipationless current (supercurrent) can flow through the device owing to the Josephson effect. A Josephson coupling, as measured by the zero-resistance supercurrent, has been obtained using tunnel barriers, superconducting constrictions, normal metals and semiconductors. The coupling mechanisms vary from tunnelling to Andreev reflection. The latter process has hitherto been observed only in normal-type systems with a continuous density of electronic states. Here we investigate a supercurrent flowing through a discrete density of states-that is, the quantized single particle energy states of a quantum dot, or `artificial atom', placed between superconducting electrodes. For this purpose, we exploit the quantum properties of finite-sized carbon nanotubes. By means of a gate electrode, successive discrete energy states are tuned on- and off-resonance with the Fermi energy in the superconducting leads, resulting in a periodic modulation of the critical current and a non-trivial correlation between the conductance in the normal state and the supercurrent. We find, in good agreement with existing theory, that the product of the critical current and the normal state resistance becomes an oscillating function, in contrast to being constant as in previously explored regimes.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate two serially aligned quantum dots in the molecular regime of large tunnel couplings t. A Zeeman field B is used to tune the energy difference of singlet and triplet spin configurations. Attaching this geometry to BCS source and drain leads with gap {\^I}'' and phase difference {\"I}† gives rise to an equilibrium supercurrent J. To compute J in the presence of Coulomb interactions U between the dot electrons, we employ the functional renormalization group (FRG). For B{\^a}‰ˆt, where the singlet and (one out of a) triplet spin states are equal in energy, the current exhibits characteristics of a 0-{\"I}€ transition similar to a single impurity. Its magnitude in the {\"I}€ phase, however, jumps discontinuously at B=t, being smaller on the triplet side. By exploiting the flexibility of the FRG, we demonstrate that this effect is generic and calculate J for realistic experimental parameters {\^I}'', U, and gate voltages {\'E}›. To obtain a more thorough understanding of the discontinuity, we analytically treat the limit {\^I}''={\^a}ˆ{\v z}, where one can access the exact many-particle states. Finally, carrying out perturbation theory in the dot-lead couplings substantiates the intuitive picture that Cooper-pair tunneling is favored by a singlet spin configuration while inhibited by a triplet one.},

The corresponding flow equations can be solved analytically, which allows to identify all microscopic cutoff scales. Exploring the entire parameter space we find rich non-equilibrium physics which cannot be understood by simply considering the bias voltage as an infrared cutoff. For the experimentally relevant case of left-right asymmetric couplings, the current generically shows a power law suppression for large V.

A detailed derivation of the flow equations for the dot level positions, the interdot hybridizations, and the effective interaction is presented. For specific setups and parameter sets we compare the results to existing accurate numerical renormalization group data. This shows that our approach covers the essential physics and is quantitatively correct up to fairly large Coulomb interactions while being much faster, very flexible, and simple to implement. We then demonstrate the power of our method to uncover interesting new physics. In several dots coupled in series the combined effect of correlations and asymmetry leads to a vanishing of transmission resonances.

Using the numerical and functional renormalization group methods we study the entire parameter space for spin-polarized as well as spin-degenerate dots, modelled by spinless or spinful electrons, respectively. We investigate the effect of finite temperatures T. For small T and sufficiently small single-particle spacings δ of the dot levels we find π phase lapses between two transmission peaks in an overwhelming part of the parameter space of the level-lead couplings. For large δ the appearance or not of a phase lapse between resonances depends on the relative sign of the level-lead couplings in analogy to the U = 0 case. We show that this generic scenario is the same for spin-polarized and spin-degenerate dots. We emphasize that in contrast to dots with more levels, for a two-level dot with small δ and generic dot-lead couplings (that is up to cases with special symmetry) the 'universal' phase lapse behaviour is already established at U = 0. The most important effect of the Coulomb interaction is to increase the separation of the transmission resonances. The relation of the appearance of phase lapses to the inversion of the population of the dot levels is discussed. For the spin-polarized case and low temperatures we compare our results to recent mean-field studies. For small δ correlations are found to strongly alter the mean-field picture.},

  Abstract                 = {We use the Matsubara functional renormalization group (FRG) to describe electronic correlations within the single impurity Anderson model. In contrast to standard FRG calculations, we account for the frequency dependence of the two-particle vertex in order to address finite-energy properties (e.g, spectral functions). By comparing with data obtained from the numerical renormalization group (NRG) framework, the FRG approximation is shown to work well for arbitrary parameters (particularly finite temperatures) provided that the electron-electron interaction U is not too large. We demonstrate that aspects of (large U) Kondo physics which are described well by a simpler frequency-independent truncation scheme are no longer captured by the 'higher-order' frequency-dependent approximation. In contrast, at small to intermediate U the results obtained by the more elaborate scheme agree better with NRG data. We suggest to parametrize the two-particle vertex not by three independent energy variables but by introducing three functions each of a single frequency. This considerably reduces the numerical effort to integrate the FRG flow equations.},

  Abstract                 = {We study a quantum dot Josephson junction inside an Aharonov-Bohm environment. The geometry is modeled by an Anderson impurity coupled to two directly linked BCS leads. We illustrate that the well-established picture of the low-energy physics being governed by an interplay of two distinct (singlet and doublet) phases is still valid for this interferometric setup. The phase boundary depends, however, nonmonotonically on the coupling strength between the superconductors, causing the system to exhibit re-entrance behavior and multiple phase transitions. We compute the zero-temperature Josephson current and demonstrate that it can become negative in the singlet phase by virtue of the Coulomb interaction U . As a starting point, the limit of large superconducting energy gaps Δ=∞ is solved analytically. In order to tackle arbitrary Δ<∞ and U>0 , we employ a truncated functional renormalization-group scheme which was previously demonstrated to give quantitatively reliable results for the quantum dot Josephson problem.},

  Abstract                 = {We illustrate how to calculate the finite-temperature linear-response conductance of quantum impurity models from the Matsubara Green's function. A continued fraction expansion of the Fermi distribution is employed which was recently introduced by Ozaki [Phys. Rev. B 75, 035123 (2007)10.1103/PhysRevB.75.035123] and converges much faster than the usual Matsubara representation. We give a simplified derivation of Ozaki's idea using concepts from condensed matter theory and present results for the rate of convergence. In case that the Green's function of some model of interest is only known numerically, interpolating between Matsubara frequencies is much more stable than carrying out an analytic continuation to the real axis. We demonstrate this explicitly by considering an infinite tight-binding chain with a single site impurity as an exactly solvable test system, showing that it is advantageous to calculate transport properties directly on the imaginary axis. The formalism is applied to the single impurity Anderson model and the linear conductance at finite temperatures is calculated reliably at small to intermediate Coulomb interactions by virtue of the Matsubara functional renormalization group. Thus, this quantum many-body method combined with the continued fraction expansion of the Fermi function constitutes a promising tool to address more complex quantum dot geometries at finite temperatures.},

Being mostly unexplored in the context of quantum impurity systems out of equilibrium, we benchmark this method against recently published time-dependent density matrix renormalization group data. We thoroughly investigate the scaling limit Γ→∞ characterized by the appearance of power laws. Most importantly, at the particle-hole symmetric point the steady-state current decays like J˜V-αJ as a function of the bias voltage V≫t' , with an exponent αJ(U) that we calculate to leading order in the Coulomb interaction strength.

It is possible to obtain individual tubes with a room-temperature resistance smaller than 40 kΩ, which remain metallic down to very low temperatures. When the contact pads are superconducting, nanotubes exhibit proximity-induced superconductivity with surprisingly large values of supercurrent. We have also recently observed intrinsic superconductivity in ropes of single-walled carbon nanotubes connected to normal contacts, when the distance between the normal electrodes is large enough, since otherwise superconductivity is destroyed by (inverse) proximity effect. These experiments indicate the presence of attractive interactions in carbon nanotubes which overcome Coulomb repulsive interactions at low temperature, and enable investigation of superconductivity in a one-dimensional limit never explored before.},

We show that the consideration of one-particle reducible six-point (as well as higher order) vertices is crucially important for the diagrammatic consistency of this approach. In particular, the relation between the dual and lattice self-energy, derived in the dual fermion approach, implicitly accounts for the effect of the diagrams, containing six-point and higher order local one-particle reducible vertices, and should be applied with caution, if these vertices are neglected. Apart from that, the treatment of the self-energy feedback is also modified by six-point and higher order vertices; these vertices are also important to account for some non-local corrections to the lattice self-energy, which have the same order in the local four-point vertices as the diagrams usually considered in the approach. These observations highlight an importance of six-point and higher order vertices in the dual fermion approach, and call for the development of new schemes of treatment of non-local fluctuations, which are based on one-particle irreducible quantities.},

While the universal contributions were studied previously within the field-theoretical RG for the one-dimensional Hubbard model with linearized electronic dispersion and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with flat Fermi surface, the nonuniversal contributions to the flow of the vertices and susceptibilities appear to be important at large momenta scales. The two-loop fRG approach is also applied to the two-dimensional Hubbard model with a curved Fermi surface and the van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. The vertices and susceptibilities in the end of the flow of the two-loop approach are suppressed in comparison with both the one-loop approach with vertex projection and the modified one-loop approach with corrected vertex projection errors. The results of the two-loop approach are closer to the results of one-loop approach with the projected vertices, the difference of the results of one- and two-loop fRG approaches decreases when going away from the van Hove band filling.

  Abstract                 = {We use the dynamical vertex approximation (DΓA) with a Moriyaesque λ correction for studying the impact of antiferromagnetic fluctuations on the spectral function of the Hubbard model in two and three dimensions. Our results show the suppression of the quasiparticle weight in three dimensions and dramatically stronger impact of spin fluctuations in two dimensions where the pseudogap is formed at low enough temperatures. Even in the presence of the Hubbard subbands, the origin of the pseudogap at weak-to-intermediate coupling is in the splitting of the quasiparticle peak. At stronger coupling (closer to the insulating phase) the splitting of Hubbard subbands is expected instead. The k dependence of the self-energy appears to be also much more pronounced in two dimensions as can be observed in the k -resolved DΓA spectra, experimentally accessible by angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy in layered correlated systems.},

In the first type (type I), the coupling is strong and the Kondo effect is dominant. Levels of the Andreev bound states display anticrossing in the middle of the ridge. On the other hand, crossing of the two Andreev bound states is shown in the second type (type II) together with the 0-π transition of the Josephson junction. Our scenario is well understood in terms of only a single dimensionless parameter, kBTKmin⁡/Δ, where TKmin⁡ and Δ are the minimum Kondo temperature of a ridge and the superconducting order parameter, respectively. Our observation is consistent with measurements of the critical current, and is supported by numerical renormalization group calculations.},

For the paramagnetic Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice in infinite dimensions we calculate the local two-particle vertex for the metallic and the insulating phase. Then we go to a two-site cluster DMFT scheme for the two-dimensional Hubbard model that includes short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations and obtain the local and nonlocal two-particle vertex functions.

In the limit where charging energy is larger than the superconducting gap, we determine the subgap excitation spectrum, the corresponding supercurrent, and the differential conductance as measured by a normal-metal tunnel probe. In absence of a phase difference only one linear combination of the superconductor lead electrons couples to the spin, which gives a single YSR state. With finite phase difference, however, it is effectively a two-channel scattering problem and therefore an additional state emerges from the gap edge. The energy of the phase-dependent YSR states depend on the gate voltage and one state can cross zero energy twice inside the valley with odd occupancy. These crossings are shifted by the phase difference towards the charge degeneracy points, corresponding to larger exchange couplings. Moreover, the zero-energy crossings give rise to resonant peaks in the differential conductance with magnitude 4 e2/h . Finally, we demonstrate that the quantum fluctuations of the dot spin do not alter qualitatively any of the results.},

Most of the existing work, however, focuses on thermoelectric transport in the linear regime despite the fact that the nonlinear conductance of correlated quantum dots has been studied in some detail throughout the last decade. Here, we review our recent work on the effect of particle-hole asymmetry on the nonlinear transport properties in the vicinity of the strong coupling limit of Kondo-correlated quantum dots and extend the underlying method, a renormalized superperturbation theory on the Keldysh contour, to the thermal conductance in the nonlinear regime. We determine the charge, energy, and heat current through the nanostructure and study the nonlinear transport coefficients, the entropy production, and the fate of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the non-thermal steady-state. Our approach is based on a renormalized perturbation theory in terms of dual fermions around the particle-hole symmetric strong-coupling limit.},

We formulate FLEX+DMFT in a systematic way starting from a Luttinger-Ward functional, and apply it to study the d -wave superconductivity in the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model. The critical temperature (Tc) curve obtained in the FLEX+DMFT exhibits a dome structure as a function of the filling, which has not been clearly observed in the FLEX approach alone. We trace back the origin of the dome to the local vertex correction from DMFT that renders a filling dependence in the FLEX self-energy. We compare the results with those of GW+DMFT, where the Tc-dome structure is qualitatively reproduced due to the same vertex correction effect, but a crucial difference from FLEX+DMFT is that Tc is always estimated below the Néel temperature in GW+DMFT. The single-particle spectral function obtained with FLEX+DMFT exhibits a double-peak structure as a precursor of the Hubbard bands at temperatures above Tc.},

On the other hand, when the quantum dot is tightly coupled to the superconducting lead, the current is increased by the introduction of a Coulomb interaction, which originates from the competition between the Kondo and proximity effects.

  Abstract                 = {Based on the s-d interaction model for dilute magnetic alloys we have calculated the scattering probability of the conduction electrons to the second Born approximation. Because of the dynamical character of the localized spin system, the Pauli principle should be taken into account in the intermediate states of the second order terms. Thus the effect of the Fermi sphere is involved in the scattering probability and gives rise to a singular term in the resistivity which involves c log T as a factor, where c is the concentration of impurity atoms. When combined with the lattice resistivity, this gives rise to a resistance minimum, provided the s-d exchange integral J is negative. The temperature at which the minimum ccurs is proportional to c1/5 and the depth of the minimum to c, as is observed. The predicted log T dependence is tested with available experiments and is confirmed. The value of J to have fit with experiments is about -0.2 ev, which is of reasonable magnitude. Our conclusion is that J should be negative in alloys which show a resistance minimum. It is argued that the resistance minimum is a result of the sharp Fermi surface.},

In particular, we show that the self-energy Σ [G ]∝δ Φ [G ]/δ G is not a single-valued functional of G : in addition to the physical solution for Σ [G ] , there exists at least one qualitatively distinct unphysical branch. This result is demonstrated for several models: the Hubbard atom, the Anderson impurity model, and the full two-dimensional Hubbard model. Despite this pathology, the skeleton Feynman diagrammatic series for Σ in terms of G is found to converge at least for moderately low temperatures. However, at strong interactions, its convergence is to the unphysical branch. This reveals a new scenario of breaking down of diagrammatic expansions. In contrast, the bare series in terms of the noninteracting Green's function G0 converges to the correct physical branch of Σ in all cases currently accessible by diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations. In addition to their conceptual importance, these observations have important implications for techniques based on the explicit summation of the diagrammatic series.},

The fluctuations are determined self-consistently, which are reflected into the one-particle self-energy via the Schwinger-Dyson equation. We demonstrate the application of the present theory to the impurity Anderson model and the Hubbard model on a square lattice mainly for the particle-hole symmetric case. In both models the vertex renormalization in the spin channel eliminates magnetic instabilities of mean-field theory to ensure the Mermin-Wagner theorem. The present theory gives the same critical exponents of the self-consistent renormalization theory in the quantum critical region. },

Here we report a direct measurement of the Zeeman effect on the Andreev levels of a semiconductor quantum dot with large electron g-factor, strongly coupled to a conventional superconductor with a large critical magnetic field. This material combination allows spin degeneracy to be lifted without destroying superconductivity. We show that a spin-split Andreev level crossing the Fermi energy results in a quantum phase transition to a spin-polarized state, which implies a change in the fermionic parity of the system. This crossing manifests itself as a zero-bias conductance anomaly at finite magnetic field with properties that resemble those expected for Majorana modes in a topological superconductor. Although this resemblance is understood without evoking topological superconductivity, the observed parity transitions could be regarded as precursors of Majorana modes in the long-wire limit.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the Josephson effect through a two-level quantum dot with an exchange coupling between two dot electrons. We compute the superconducting phase relationship and construct the phase diagram in the superconducting gap-exchange coupling plane in the regime of the singlet-triplet transition driven by the exchange coupling. In our study two configurations for the dot-lead coupling are considered: one where effectively only one channel couples to the dot and the other where the two dot orbitals have opposite parities. Perturbative analysis in the weak-coupling limit reveals that the system experiences transitions from 0 to π (negative critical current) behavior, depending on the parity of the orbitals and the spin correlation between dot electrons. The strong coupling regime is tackled with the numerical renormalization group method, which first characterizes the Kondo correlations due to the dot-lead coupling and the exchange coupling in the absence of superconductivity. In the presence of superconductivity, many-body correlations such as two-stage Kondo effect compete with the superconductivity and the comparison between the gap and the relevant Kondo temperature scales allows to predict a rich variety of phase diagrams for the ground state of the system and for the Josephson current. Numerical calculations predict that our system can exhibit Kondo-driven 0-π-0 or π-0-π double transitions and, more interestingly, that if proper conditions are met a Kondo-assisted π junction can arise, which is contrary to a common belief that the Kondo effect opens a resonant level and makes the 0 junction.

  Abstract                 = {This article reviews the physics of high-temperature superconductors from the point of view of the doping of a Mott insulator. The basic electronic structure of cuprates is reviewed, emphasizing the physics of strong correlation and establishing the model of a doped Mott insulator as a starting point. A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region of the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where the behavior is most anomalous. The normal state in this region exhibits pseudogap phenomenon. In contrast, the quasiparticles in the superconducting state are well defined and behave according to theory. This review introduces Anderson’s idea of the resonating valence bond and argues that it gives a qualitative account of the data. The importance of phase fluctuations is discussed, leading to a theory of the transition temperature, which is driven by phase fluctuations and the thermal excitation of quasiparticles. However, an argument is made that phase fluctuations can only explain pseudogap phenomenology over a limited temperature range, and some additional physics is needed to explain the onset of singlet formation at very high temperatures. A description of the numerical method of the projected wave function is presented, which turns out to be a very useful technique for implementing the strong correlation constraint and leads to a number of predictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper deals with an analytic treatment of the t-J model, with the goal of putting the resonating valence bond idea on a more formal footing. The slave boson is introduced to enforce the constraint againt double occupation and it is shown that the implementation of this local constraint leads naturally to gauge theories. This review follows the historical order by first examining the U(1) formulation of the gauge theory. Some inadequacies of this formulation for underdoping are discussed, leading to the SU(2) formulation. Here follows a rather thorough discussion of the role of gauge theory in describing the spin-liquid phase of the undoped Mott insulator. The difference between the high-energy gauge group in the formulation of the problem versus the low-energy gauge group, which is an emergent phenomenon, is emphasized. Several possible routes to deconfinement based on different emergent gauge groups are discussed, which leads to the physics of fractionalization and spin-charge separation. Next the extension of the SU(2) formulation to nonzero doping is described with a focus on a part of the mean-field phase diagram called the staggered flux liquid phase. It will be shown that inclusion of the gauge fluctuation provides a reasonable description of the pseudogap phase. It is emphasized that d -wave superconductivity can be considered as evolving from a stable U(1) spin liquid. These ideas are applied to the high- Tc cuprates, and their implications for the vortex structure and the phase diagram are discussed. A possible test of the topological structure of the pseudogap phase is described.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, we present a nonlocal expansion scheme to study correlated electron systems aiming at a better description of its spatial fluctuations at all length scales. Taking the nonlocal coupling as a perturbation to the local degrees of freedom, we show that the nonlocality in the self-energy function can be efficiently constructed from the coupling between local fluctuations. It can provide one unified framework to incorporate nonlocality to both ordered and disordered correlated many-body fermion systems. In this application, we prove that the dual-fermion approach can be understood as a special case of this nonlocal expansion scheme. The scheme presented in this work is constructed without introducing any dual variable, in which the interacting nature and the correlated behaviors of the lattice fermions have a clear physics correspondence. Thus, in this special case, the equivalence of the dual-fermion approach to the nonlocal expansion scheme beautifully reveals the physics origin of the dual variables. We show that the noninteracting dual-fermion Green's function corresponds exactly to a nonlocal coupling of the lattice fermion renormalized by the local single-particle charge fluctuations, and the dual-fermion self-energy behaves as the one-particle fully irreducible components of the lattice Green's function. Not only limited to this specific example, the nonlocal expansion scheme presented in this work can also be applied to other problems depending on the choice of the local degrees of freedom.},

We identify the two-particle reducible vertex as the core function that is essential for the construction of the other vertex functions. This observation stimulates us to consider a two-level parameter reduction for this function to simplify the solution of the parquet equations. The resulting functions, which depend on fewer arguments, are coined "kernel functions." With the use of the kernel functions, the open boundary of various vertex functions in Matsubara-frequency space can be faithfully satisfied. We justify our implementation by accurately reproducing the dynamical mean-field theory results from momentum-independent parquet calculations. The high-frequency asymptotics of the single-particle self-energy and the two-particle vertex are correctly reproduced, which turns out to be essential for the self-consistent determination of the parquet solutions. The current implementation is also feasible for the dynamical vertex approximation.},

Moreover, the interplay between charging and spin-orbit effects in the Coulomb blockade and cotunneling regimes leads to a rich phase diagram with well-defined (analytical) boundaries in parameter space. Finally, the 0 phase always prevails in the Kondo regime. Our calculations are relevant in view of recent experimental advances in transport through ultraclean carbon nanotubes.},

Within dynamical mean-field theory, this impurity problem provides a link to the periodic Anderson model (PAM) with superconducting conduction electrons (BCS-PAM). The first-order transition observed in the impurity model is reproduced in the BCS-PAM and is signalized by the crossing of the low-energy excitations in the local density of states. The momentum resolved single-particle spectral function in the singlet state reveals the coherent, Bloch-type, superposition of Andreev bound states.

  Abstract                 = {We discuss different approximations for effective low-energy interactions in multiband models for weakly correlated electrons. In the study of Fermi-surface instabilities of the conduction band(s), the standard approximation consists only keeping those terms in the bare interactions that couple only to the conduction band(s), while corrections due to virtual excitations into bands away from the Fermi surface are typically neglected. Here, using a functional renormalization group approach, we present an improved truncation for the treatment of the effective interactions in the conduction band that keeps track of the generated three-particle interactions (six-point term) and hence allows one to include important aspects of these virtual interband excitations. Within a simplified two-patch treatment of the conduction band, we demonstrate that these corrections can have a rather strong effect in parts of the phase diagram by changing the critical scales for various orderings and the phase boundaries.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantum-state engineering, i.e., active control over the coherent dynamics of suitable quantum-mechanical systems, has become a fascinating prospect of modern physics. With concepts developed in atomic and molecular physics and in the context of NMR, the field has been stimulated further by the perspectives of quantum computation and communication. Low-capacitance Josephson tunneling junctions offer a promising way to realize quantum bits (qubits) for quantum information processing. The article reviews the properties of these devices and the practical and fundamental obstacles to their use. Two kinds of device have been proposed, based on either charge or phase (flux) degrees of freedom. Single- and two-qubit quantum manipulations can be controlled by gate voltages in one case and by magnetic fields in the other case. Both kinds of device can be fabricated with present technology. In flux qubit devices, an important milestone, the observation of superpositions of different flux states in the system eigenstates, has been achieved. The Josephson charge qubit has even demonstrated coherent superpositions of states readable in the time domain. There are two major problems that must be solved before these devices can be used for quantum information processing. One must have a long phase coherence time, which requires that external sources of dephasing be minimized. The review discusses relevant parameters and provides estimates of the decoherence time. Another problem is in the readout of the final state of the system. This issue is illustrated with a possible realization by a single-electron transistor capacitively coupled to the Josephson device, but general properties of measuring devices are also discussed. Finally, the review describes how the basic physical manipulations on an ideal device can be combined to perform useful operations.},

  Abstract                 = {We study a carbon-nanotube quantum dot embedded in a superconducting-quantum-interference-device loop in order to investigate the competition of strong electron correlations with a proximity effect. Depending on whether local pairing or local magnetism prevails, a superconducting quantum dot will exhibit a positive or a negative supercurrent, referred to as a 0 or π Josephson junction, respectively. In the regime of a strong Coulomb blockade, the 0-to-π transition is typically controlled by a change in the discrete charge state of the dot, from even to odd. In contrast, at a larger tunneling amplitude, the Kondo effect develops for an odd-charge (magnetic) dot in the normal state, and quenches magnetism. In this situation, we find that a first-order 0-to-π quantum phase transition can be triggered at a fixed valence when superconductivity is brought in, due to the competition of the superconducting gap and the Kondo temperature. The superconducting-quantum-interference-device geometry together with the tunability of our device allows the exploration of the associated phase diagram predicted by recent theories. We also report on the observation of anharmonic behavior of the current-phase relation in the transition regime, which we associate with the two accessible superconducting states. Our results finally demonstrate that the spin-singlet nature of the Kondo state helps to enhance the stability of the 0 phase far from the mixed-valence regime in odd-charge superconducting quantum dots.},

We first consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger model using bosonization. For weak interactions the boundary exponent of the power-law suppression of the spectral weight close to the chemical potential is dominated by a term linear in the interaction. This motivates us to study the spectral properties also within the Hartree-Fock approximation. It already gives power-law behavior and qualitative agreement with the exact spectral function. For the lattice model of spinless fermions and the Hubbard model we present numerically exact results obtained using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm. We show that many aspects of the behavior of the spectral function close to the boundary can again be understood within the Hartree-Fock approximation. For the repulsive Hubbard model with interaction U the spectral weight is enhanced in a large energy range around the chemical potential. At smaller energies a power-law suppression, as predicted by bosonization, sets in. We present an analytical discussion of the crossover and show that for small U it occurs at energies exponentially (in -1/U) close to the chemical potential, i.e. that bosonization only holds on exponentially small energy scales. We show that such a crossover can also be found in other models.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a general perturbative framework based on a superconducting atomic limit for the description of Andreev bound states (ABS) in interacting quantum dots connected to superconducting leads. A local effective Hamiltonian for dressed ABS, including both the atomic (or molecular) levels and the induced proximity effect on the dot is argued to be a natural starting point. A self-consistent expansion in single-particle tunneling events is shown to provide accurate results even in regimes where the superconducting gap is smaller than the atomic energies, as demonstrated by a comparison to recent numerical renormalization group calculations. This simple formulation may have bearings for interpreting Andreev spectroscopic experiments in superconducting devices, such as scanning tunnel microscope measurements on carbon nanotubes or radiative emission in optical quantum dots.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerous correlated electron systems exhibit a strongly scale-dependent behavior. Upon lowering the energy scale, collective phenomena, bound states, and new effective degrees of freedom emerge. Typical examples include (i) competing magnetic, charge, and pairing instabilities in two-dimensional electron systems; (ii) the interplay of electronic excitations and order parameter fluctuations near thermal and quantum phase transitions in metals; and (iii) correlation effects such as Luttinger liquid behavior and the Kondo effect showing up in linear and nonequilibrium transport through quantum wires and quantum dots. The functional renormalization group is a flexible and unbiased tool for dealing with such scale-dependent behavior. Its starting point is an exact functional flow equation, which yields the gradual evolution from a microscopic model action to the final effective action as a function of a continuously decreasing energy scale. Expanding in powers of the fields one obtains an exact hierarchy of flow equations for vertex functions. Truncations of this hierarchy have led to powerful new approximation schemes. This review is a comprehensive introduction to the functional renormalization group method for interacting Fermi systems. A self-contained derivation of the exact flow equations is presented and frequently used truncation schemes are described. Reviewing selected applications it is shown how approximations based on the functional renormalization group can be fruitfully used to improve our understanding of correlated fermion systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The interplay between various many-body effects in a quantum dot attached to two normal and one superconducting lead is considered in the limit of a large superconducting gap. By the proximity effect the superconducting lead induces pairing correlations on the quantum dot. In the subgap region one observes the anomalous tunneling via direct and crossed Andreev scattering, whereas the usual single particle electronic transfer is suppressed. The interactions of electrons on the dot leading to such phenomena as the Coulomb blockade and the Kondo effect severely modify the currents flowing in the system. In particular: (i) They prevent the existence of the negative differential conductance observed for a noninteracting quantum dot over the whole range of voltages, (ii) affect the distribution of the currents as a function of the applied voltage, and (iii) lead to the appearance of an additional low bias feature due to the formation of the Abrikosov-Suhl resonance. The nonlocal correlations in the Coulomb blockade regime are most pronounced for the particle-hole symmetric dot and thus can be easily tuned by means of gate voltage. They are observed even in the Kondo regime and dominate the behavior close to the Abrikosov-Suhl resonance showing convincingly that Kondo correlations do not destroy subtle entanglement between electrons.},

The transmission probability, by which the conductance is expressed as g = (2e2/h) \int dɛ (- \partial f / \partial ɛ) \mathcal{T}(ɛ), is introduced for interacting electrons. Here f(ɛ) is the Fermi function, and the transmission probability T(ɛ) is defined in terms of a current vertex or a three-point correlation function. We apply this formulation to a series of Anderson impurities of size N (=1, 2, 3, 4), and calculate T(ɛ) using the order U2 self-energy and current vertex which satisfy a generalized Ward identity. The results show that T(ɛ) has much information about the excitation spectrum: T(ɛ) has two broad peaks of the upper and lower Hubbard bands in addition to N resonant peaks which have direct correspondence with the noninteracting spectrum.

  Abstract                 = {We study low-energy transport through a quantum dot coupled to one normal and two superconducting (SC) leads in a Y-shaped junction. In this geometry a crossover between Kondo-dominated and Cooper-pairing-dominated states occurs by tuning parameters such as the quantized energy level ɛd of the dot and the Josephson phase ϕ, which induces a supercurrent flowing between the two SC leads through the dot. Furthermore, Andreev scattering takes place at the interface between the dot and normal lead. The low-lying energy states of this system can be described by a local Fermi-liquid theory for interacting Bogoliubov particles. In a description based on an Anderson impurity model, we calculate transport coefficients, renormalized parameters, and spectral function, using Wilson's numerical renormalization group approach, in the limit of a large SC gap. Our results demonstrate how the Andreev resonance level approaches the Fermi level in the crossover region between the Cooper-pairing singlet state and the strong-coupling situation as ɛd or ϕ are varied. The strong-coupling situation shows a Kondo effect with a significantly renormalized resonance width. The crossover is smeared when the coupling between the dot and the normal lead is large. Furthermore, asymmetry in the Josephson junction suppresses the cancellations of the SC proximity for finite ϕ, and it favors the SC singlet state rather than the Kondo singlet.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a minimal model for the Josephson current through a quantum dot in a Kondo regime. We start with the model that consists of an Anderson impurity connected to two superconducting (SC) leads with the gaps {\^I}''{\^I}$\pm$=|{\^I}''{\^I}$\pm$| ei {\^I}¸{\^I}$\pm$, where {\^I}$\pm$ = L, R for the lead at left and right. We show that, when one of the SC gaps is much larger than the others |{\^I}''L| {\^a}‰« |{\^I}''R|, the starting model can be mapped exactly onto the single-channel model, which consists of the right lead of {\^I}''R and the Anderson impurity with an extra onsite SC gap of {\^I}''d \equiv {\^I}``L ei {\^I}¸L. Here {\^I}¸L and {\^I}``L are defined with respect to the starting model, and {\^I}``L is the level width due to the coupling with the left lead. Based on this simplified model,we study the ground-state properties for the asymmetric gap, |{\^I}''L| {\^a}‰« |{\^I}''R|, using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. The results show that the phase difference of the SC gaps {\"I}† \equiv {\^I}¸R -{\^I}¸L, which induces the Josephson current, disturbs the screening of the local moment to destabilize the singlet ground state typical of the Kondo system. It can also drive the quantum phase transition to a magnetic doublet ground state, and at the critical point the Josephson current shows a discontinuous change. The asymmetry of the two SC gaps causes a re-entrant magnetic phase, in which the in-gap bound state lies close to the Fermi level.},

Experiments to date have examined a multitude of molecules conducting in parallel, or, in some cases, transport through single molecules. The latter includes molecules probed in a two-terminal geometry using mechanically controlled break junctions or scanning probes as well as three-terminal single-molecule transistors made from carbon nanotubes, C60 molecules, and conjugated molecules diluted in a less-conducting molecular layer. The ultimate limit would be a device where electrons hop on to, and off from, a single atom between two contacts. Here we describe transistors incorporating a transition-metal complex designed so that electron transport occurs through well-defined charge states of a single atom. We examine two related molecules containing a Co ion bonded to polypyridyl ligands, attached to insulating tethers of different lengths. Changing the length of the insulating tether alters the coupling of the ion to the electrodes, enabling the fabrication of devices that exhibit either single-electron phenomena, such as Coulomb blockade, or the Kondo effect.},

We employ a recently developed fermionic functional Renormalization Group scheme which allows for highly resolved calculations of wavevector dependences in the low-energy effective interactions. We encounter the expected anti-ferromagnetic spin density wave for a dominant on-site repulsion between electrons, and charge order with different modulations for dominant pure $n$-th nearest neighbor repulsive interactions. Novel instabilities towards incommensurate charge density waves take place when non-local density interactions among several bond distances are included simultaneously. Moreover, for more realistic Coulomb potentials in graphene including enough non-local terms there is a suppression of charge order due to competition effects between the different charge ordering tendencies, and if the on-site term fails to dominate, the semi-metallic state is rendered stable. The possibility of a topological Mott insulator being the favored tendency for dominating second nearest neighbor interactions is not realized in our results with high momentum resolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are not intrinsically superconducting but they can carry a supercurrent when connected to superconducting electrodes. This supercurrent is mainly transmitted by discrete entangled electron-hole states confined to the nanotube, called Andreev Bound States (ABS). These states are a key concept in mesoscopic superconductivity as they provide a universal description of Josephson-like effects in quantum-coherent nanostructures (e.g. molecules, nanowires, magnetic or normal metallic layers) connected to superconducting leads. We report here the first tunneling spectroscopy of individually resolved ABS, in a nanotube-superconductor device. Analyzing the evolution of the ABS spectrum with a gate voltage, we show that the ABS arise from the discrete electronic levels of the molecule and that they reveal detailed information about the energies of these levels, their relative spin orientation and the coupling to the leads. Such measurements hence constitute a powerful new spectroscopic technique capable of elucidating the electronic structure of CNT-based devices, including those with well-coupled leads. This is relevant for conventional applications (e.g. superconducting or normal transistors, SQUIDs) and quantum information processing (e.g. entangled electron pairs generation, ABS-based qubits). Finally, our device is a new type of dc-measurable SQUID.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a perturbative theory for the thermodynamic properties of a mixed-valent impurity in a metal. The impurity has two ionic configurations fn-1 and fn (nondegenerate and nλ-fold degenerate, respectively) with energies ɛ0 and (ɛ~f+μ), the difference (ɛ~f-ɛ0) being small. They mix via hybridization with conduction electrons (matrix element Vkf). We show that for D>(ɛ~f-ɛ0)>~-nλΔln(DnλΔ) a Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory is convergent. Here Δ=|Vkf|2ρ(μ) is the virtual level width and 2D is the conduction-electron bandwidth, ρ(μ) being the density of states at the Fermi level. The expansion parameter is the inverse of the orbital degeneracy nλ. Since this is large (6 to 8), the expansion is quite convergent, and the lowest-order theory is accurate. This is checked by calculation of higher-order terms for various values of (ɛ~f-ɛ0). In the above range of (ɛ~f-ɛ0) the f-electron number is seen to change from (n-1) to about (n-1)+0.80, so that there is a perturbative theory for a strongly-mixed-valent impurity. Hybridization stabilizes the singlet fn-1 relative to fn, the maximum stabilization energy (level shift) being approximately nλΔln(DnλΔ) for ɛ0=ɛ~f. This singlet ground state has been obtained variationally by Varma and Yafet, and from renormalization-group arguments by Haldane, and by Krishnamurthy, Wilkins, and Wilson; the Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory has been used earlier by Bringer and Lustfeld. However, the recognition of (1nλ) as an expansion parameter and the consequent simplification of the theory are new. Physical properties such as valence, susceptibility, and specific heat are calculated as a function of (kBTΔ) for various values of (ɛ~f-ɛ0). A simple way of including the effect of alloying pressure is described. Many characteristic properties of metallic dilute and concentrated mixed-valent systems, such as the temperature dependence of valence, the positive T2 slope of the low-temperature susceptibility χ(T), the broad maximum in it, the relation between χ(0) and the Curie-Weiss temperature of high-temperature susceptibility, are qualitatively explained and quantitatively characterized for the first time. The results are directly applicable to dilute and nondilute alloys. They can also be applied to concentrated perfect lattice systems except at the lowest temperatures where relatively small intersite coupling leads to a uniform Fermi-liquid ground state. The Kondo limit, i.e., the nearly-fn-valent singlet which occurs for (ɛ~f-ɛ0)<<-nλΔ, is not described by the present theory.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a lattice nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) approach to quantum XY spin models by using a mapping onto hardcore bosons. The NPRG takes as initial condition of the renormalization group flow the (local) limit of decoupled sites, allowing us to take into account the hardcore constraint exactly. The initial condition of the flow is equivalent to the large S classical results of the corresponding spin system. Furthermore, the hardcore constraint is conserved along the RG flow, and we can describe both local and long-distance fluctuations in a nontrivial way. We discuss a simple approximation scheme, and solve the corresponding flow equations. We compute both the zero-temperature thermodynamics and the finite temperature phase diagram on the square and cubic lattices. The NPRG allows us to recover the correct critical physics at finite temperature in two and three dimensions. The results compare well with numerical simulations.},

This approach yields a phase diagram in very good quantitative agreement with quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and reproduces the two universality classes of the superfluid-Mott-insulator transition. The critical behavior near the multicritical points, where the transition takes place at constant density, agrees with the original predictions of Fisher [Phys. Rev. BPRBMDO1098-012110.1103/PhysRevB.40.546 40, 546 (1989)] based on simple scaling arguments. At a generic transition point, the critical behavior is mean-field like with logarithmic corrections in two dimensions. In the weakly correlated superfluid phase (far away from the Mott insulating phase), the renormalization-group flow is controlled by the Bogoliubov fixed point down to a characteristic (Ginzburg) momentum scale kG, which is much smaller than the inverse healing length kh. In the vicinity of the multicritical points, when the density is commensurate, we identify a sharp crossover from a weakly to a strongly correlated superfluid phase where the condensate density and the superfluid stiffness are strongly suppressed and both kG and kh are of the order of the inverse lattice spacing.},

At energies close to the applied bias voltage eVsd, a parameter range exists, where radiation proceeds in pairwise emission of polarization correlated photons. At energies close to 2eVsd, emitted photons are associated with Cooper pair transfer and are reminiscent of Josephson radiation.

Finite biases beyond the linear response regime are considered. The local two-particle interaction U on the dot is treated using an approximation scheme within the functional renormalization group approach set up in Keldysh-Nambu space with U being the small parameter. For V >0, we compare our renormalization group enhanced results for the dc component of the current to earlier weak coupling approaches such as the Hartree-Fock approximation and second-order perturbation theory in U. We show that in parameter regimes in which finite-bias-driven multiple Andreev reflections prevail, small-|U| approaches become unreliable for interactions of appreciable strength. In the complementary regime, the convergence of the current with respect to numerical parameters becomes an issue, but can eventually be achieved, and interaction effects turn out to be smaller than expected based on earlier results. For ΔT >0, we find a surprising increase of the current as a function of the superconducting phase difference in the regime which at T =0 becomes the π (doublet) phase.},

  Abstract                 = {Functional renormalization group (FRG) has become a diverse and powerful tool to derive effective low-energy scattering vertices of interacting many-body systems. Starting from a free expansion point of the action, the flow of the RG parameter Λ allows us to trace the evolution of the effective one- and two-particle vertices towards low energies by taking into account the vertex corrections between all parquet channels in an unbiased fashion. In this work, we generalize the expansion point at which the diagrammatic resummation procedure is initiated from a free UV limit to a cluster product state. We formulate a cluster FRG scheme where the noninteracting building blocks (i.e., decoupled spin clusters) are treated exactly, and the intercluster couplings are addressed via RG. As a benchmark study, we apply our cluster FRG scheme to the spin-1/2 bilayer Heisenberg model (BHM) on a square lattice where the neighboring sites in the two layers form the individual two-site clusters. Comparing with existing numerical evidence for the BHM, we obtain reasonable findings for the spin susceptibility, the spin-triplet excitation energy, and quasiparticle weight even in coupling regimes close to antiferromagnetic order. The concept of cluster FRG promises applications to a large class of interacting electron systems.},

In particular, the considered approach includes one-particle reducible contributions from the three- and more-particle vertices in the dual fermion approach, as well as some diagrams not included in the ladder version of DΓA. To demonstrate the applicability and physical content of the 1PI approach, we compare the diagrammatics of 1PI, DF, and DΓA, as well as the numerical results of these approaches for the half-filled Hubbard model in two dimensions.},

  Abstract                 = {Electronic-correlated systems are often well described by dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). While DMFT studies have mainly focused hitherto on one-particle properties, valuable information is also enclosed into local two-particle Green's functions and vertices. They represent the main ingredient to compute momentum-dependent response functions at the DMFT level and to treat nonlocal spatial correlations at all length scales by means of diagrammatic extensions of DMFT. The aim of this paper is to present a DMFT analysis of the local reducible and irreducible two-particle vertex functions for the Hubbard model in the context of a unified diagrammatic formalism. An interpretation of the observed frequency structures is also given in terms of perturbation theory, of the comparison with the atomic limit, and of the mapping onto the attractive Hubbard model.},

We construct the phase diagram for the junction and discuss properties of different phases. In addition, we find the singlet and doublet state energies within a slave-boson mean-field approach.

  Abstract                 = {We develop a general theory of a boson decomposition for both local and non-local interactions in lattice fermion models which allows us to describe fermionic degrees of freedom and collective charge and spin excitations on equal footing. An efficient perturbation theory in the interaction of the fermionic and the bosonic degrees of freedom is constructed in the so-called dual variables in the path-integral formalism. This theory takes into account all local correlations of fermions and collective bosonic modes and interpolates between itinerant and localized regimes of electrons in solids. The zero-order approximation of this theory corresponds to an extended dynamical mean-field theory (EDMFT), a regular way to calculate nonlocal corrections to EDMFT is provided. It is shown that dual ladder summation gives a conserving approximation beyond EDMFT. The method is especially suitable for consideration of collective magnetic and charge excitations and allows to calculate their renormalization with respect to "bare" RPA-like characteristics. General expression for the plasmonic dispersion in correlated media is obtained. As an illustration it is shown that effective superexchange interactions in the half-filled Hubbard model can be derived within the dual-ladder approximation.},

The method starts with dynamical mean-field theory as a zeroth-order approximation and includes nonlocal effects in a perturbative way. In contrast to cluster approaches, this method utilizes an exact transition to a dual set of variables. It therefore becomes possible to treat vertices of an effective single-impurity problem as small parameters.

Jpn. 61 (1992) 3239), various problems related to the localized excited state produced by a magnetic impurity are examined in detail. In particular, the binding energy of the localized excited state, its spectral weight, one-electron and magnetic excitation spectra and the spatial variation of the order parameter are studied over the whole regime of the magnitude of TK/\varDelta (TK: Kondo temperature, \varDelta: superconducting energy gap).},

This removes factorials in the recursive equation for the Green functions, and thus improves the combinatorial behaviour. The form of the equation is also ideal for the investigation of many-fermion systems, where the propagator is singular on a surface. For these systems, I define a criterion for Fermi liquid behaviour which applies at positive temperatures. As a first step towards establishing such behaviour in d>= 2, I prove basic regularity properties of the interacting Fermi surface to all orders in a skeleton expansion. The proof is a considerable simplification of previous ones.},

This method does not require a Hubbard-Stratonovich decoupling of the interaction. Instead an infinitesimally small symmetry-breaking component is inserted into the initial action, as an initial condition for the flow of the self-energy. Its flow is driven by the interaction, and at low scales it saturates at a nonzero value if there is a tendency for spontaneous symmetry breaking in the corresponding channel. For the reduced BCS model, we show how a small initial gap amplitude flows to the value given by the exact solution of the model. We also discuss the emergence of the Goldstone boson in this approach.},

This problem is studied by applying Wilson’s numerical renormalization group method. The ground state and the first excited state are traced by changing the exchange coupling constant relative to the energy gap. Thereby the position of the localized excited state within the energy gap is determined over the whole regime of the magnitude of TK/\varDelta (TK: Kondo temperature, \varDelta: superconducting energy gap). A crossing of the lowest doublet and singlet is clearly observed at TK/\varDelta≃0.3. The ferromagnetic and Ising cases have been studied also. In the ferromagnetic case the localized excited state stays close to the gap edge since the exchange coupling is renormalized to a weak coupling. The case of the Ising-like sd coupling, which is exactly solvable, can be used to check the reliability of the present approach and the effect of the discretization.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a new formulation of the functional renormalization group (RG) for interacting fermions. Our approach unifies the purely fermionic formulation based on the Grassmannian functional integral, which has been used in recent years by many authors, with the traditional Wilsonian RG approach to quantum systems pioneered by Hertz [Phys. Rev. B 14, 1165 (1976)], which attempts to describe the infrared behavior of the system in terms of an effective bosonic theory associated with the soft modes of the underlying fermionic problem. In our approach, we decouple the interaction by means of a suitable Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation (following the Hertz approach), but do not eliminate the fermions; instead, we derive an exact hierarchy of RG flow equations for the irreducible vertices of the resulting coupled field theory involving both fermionic and bosonic fields. The freedom of choosing a momentum transfer cutoff for the bosonic soft modes in addition to the usual band cutoff for the fermions opens the possibility of new RG schemes. In particular, we show how the exact solution of the Tomonaga-Luttinger model (i.e., one-dimensional fermions with linear energy dispersion and interactions involving only small momentum transfers) emerges from the functional RG if one works with a momentum transfer cutoff. Then the Ward identities associated with the local particle conservation at each Fermi point are valid at every stage of the RG flow and provide a solution of an infinite hierarchy of flow equations for the irreducible vertices. The RG flow equation for the irreducible single-particle self-energy can then be closed and can be reduced to a linear integrodifferential equation, the solution of which yields the result familiar from bosonization. We suggest new truncation schemes of the exact hierarchy of flow equations, which might be useful even outside the weak coupling regime.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze the highly non-perturbative regime surrounding the Mott-Hubbard metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) by means of dynamical mean field theory calculations at the two-particle level. By extending the results of T. Schaefer, et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 246405 (2013)] we show the existence of infinitely many lines in the phase diagram of the Hubbard model where the local Bethe-Salpeter equations, and the related irreducible vertex functions, become singular in the charge as well as the particle-particle channel. These divergence lines accumulate around the critical Mott endpoint in accordance with the interpretation as precursors of the MIT. By comparing our numerical data with analytical calculations of increasing complexity, such as for the disordered Binary Mixture and Falicov-Kimball (FK) models, as well as for the atomic limit (AL) case, (i) we identify two different kinds of divergences lines; (ii) we classify them in terms of the frequency-structure of the associated singular eigenvectors; (iii) we investigate their relation to the multiple branches in the Luttinger-Ward formalism. Moreover, we could distinguish the situations where the multiple divergences simply reflect the emergence of an underlying, unique energy scale $\nu^*$ below which perturbation theory does no longer apply, from those where the breakdown of perturbation theory affects, not trivially, different energy regimes. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results on the theoretical understanding of the non-perturbative physics around the MIT and for future developments of many-body algorithms applicable in this regime.},

Moreover, we study the response of the ABS to nonlocal transport processes, namely, Cooper pair splitting and elastic co-tunnelling, which are enabled by a second QD fabricated on the same nanotube on the opposite side of S. We find an appreciable nonlocal conductance with a rich structure, including a sign reversal at the ground-state transition from the ABS singlet to a degenerate magnetic doublet. We describe our device by a simple rate equation model that captures the key features of our observations and demonstrates that the sign of the nonlocal conductance is a measure for the charge distribution of the ABS, given by the respective Bogoliubov-de Gennes amplitudes u and v.},

The problem is mapped onto the anisotropic Kondo problem in an external magnetic field. Using the Ward identity for the total charge conservation we derive an exact relation between the specific heat and the charge susceptibility at low temperatures. Using a renormalization-group approach and the analogy to the x-ray threshold problem, we show that the impurity behaves like a resonant level with a renormalized resonance width. We give expressions for the charge susceptibility and the specific heat. The extension to a compound of noninteracting f-level impurities shows that discontinuous valence transitions are possible in models involving local and incoherent valence fluctuations.},

Its applications to the calculation of static, dynamic, and thermodynamic quantities in these systems are reviewed here. The potential of DMRG applications in the fields of two-dimensional quantum systems, quantum chemistry, three-dimensional small grains, nuclear physics, equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics, and time-dependent phenomena is also discussed. This review additionally considers the theoretical foundations of the method, examining its relationship to matrix-product states and the quantum information content of the density matrices generated by the DMRG.},

  Abstract                 = {The transport properties of electronic devices are usually characterized on the basis of conductance measurements. Such measurements are adequate for devices in which transport occurs incoherently, but for very small devices-such as quantum dots1,2-the wave nature of the electrons plays an important role3. Because the phase of an electron's wavefunction changes as it passes through such a device, phase measurements are required to characterize the transport properties fully. Here we report the results of a double-slit interference experiment which permits the measurement of the phase-shift of an electron traversing a quantum dot. This is accomplished by inserting the quantum dot into one arm of an interferometer, thereby introducing a measurable phase shift between the arms. We find that the phase evolution within a resonance of the quantum dot can be accounted for qualitatively by a model that ignores the interactions between the electrons within the dot. Although these electrons must interact strongly, such interactions apparently have no observable effect on the phase. On the other hand, we also find that the phase behaviour is identical for all resonances, and that there is a sharp jump of the phase between successive resonance peaks. Adequate explanation of these features may require a model that includes interactions between electrons.},

Moreover, there is the tendency to occupy the same level also by the second electron within the same resonance. This second electron is taken from the narrow levels in the dot. The narrow levels are populated (and broad level is depopulated) via sharp rearrangements of the electronic configuration in the Coulomb blockade valleys. Possible experimental manifestations of this scenario are considered. Among these there are sharp features in the valleys and in the mixed-valence regime and an unusual Kondo effect.},

In particular, the width of one strongly coupled level may be larger than the spacing between other, very narrow, levels. In this case many consecutive Coulomb blockade peaks are due to occupation of the same broad level. Between the peaks the electron jumps from this level to one of the narrow levels, and the transmission through the dot at the next resonance essentially repeats that at the previous one. This offers a natural explanation to the recently observed behavior of the transmission phase in an interferometer with a QD.},

Although theoretically predicted almost 40 years ago, no direct spectroscopic evidence of these Andreev bound states exists to date. We propose a novel type of spectroscopy based on embedding a superconducting constriction, formed by a single-level molecule junction, in a microwave QED cavity environment. In the electron-dressed cavity spectrum we find a polariton excitation at twice the Andreev bound state energy, and a superconducting-phase-dependent ac Stark shift of the cavity frequency. Dispersive measurement of this frequency shift can be used for Andreev bound state spectroscopy.},

Short length-scales are treated explicitly, long ones are addressed at a dynamical mean-field level and intermediate length-regime correlations are assumed to be weak and are approximated diagrammatically. To illustrate and test this method, we apply it to the one-dimensional Hubbard model. The resulting multi-scale self-energy provides a very good quantitative agreement with substantially more numerically expensive, explicit quantum Monte Carlo calculations.},

  Abstract                 = {The scattering of a quasiparticle in a superconductor due to a magnetic impurity is calculated by a perturbation method. It is shown that the ratio of the dominant contribution of the successive order of terms in the perturbation series is given at T = 0 by the ratio 2J_{rho}log(2D/Delta) where rho is the density of state at the Fermi surface divided by the number of atoms in the superconductor, J is the magnitude of the s-d exchange interaction, 2D is the band width, and Delta is the energy gap. If this ratio is greater than one, the perturbation series does not converge. This is connected with the existence of a bound state attached to the impurity atom. Following Yosida's theory on the bound state due to the s-d interaction in a normal metal, we examine the possibility of a bound state in a superconductor. It is shown that, if the s-d interaction is antiferromagnetic and stronger than the pairing interaction, a bound state is formed around the impurity spin, and that, if it is weaker, an excited level appears in the energy gap irrespective of the sign of the interaction. The condition for the existence of the bound state is found to be the same as the condition for the divergence of the perturbation series mentioned above. The effect on the density of states of quasiparticles at finite concentration of magnetic impurities is briefly discussed.},

When crossing symmetry is not imposed, the convergence of both simple iteration and more complicated continuous loading (homotopy) methods is limited to high temperatures and weak interactions. We modify the algorithm to impose the crossing symmetry without increasing the computational complexity. We also imposed time reversal and a subset of the point group symmetries, but they did not further improve the convergence. We elaborate the details of the latency hiding scheme which can significantly improve the performance in the computational implementation. With these modifications, stable solutions for the parquet equations can be obtained by iteration more quickly even for values of the interaction that are a significant fraction of the bandwidth and for temperatures that are much smaller than the bandwidth. This may represent a crucial step towards the solution of two-particle field theories for correlated electron models.},

This behavior stands in total contrast to a wide Kondo valley seen in the normal transport. The SC proximity penetrating into the interfacial dot pushes the Kondo clouds, which screens the local moment in the side dot, toward the normal lead to make the singlet bond long.

  Abstract                 = {Asymmetry in the Josephson couplings between two superconductors through a quantum dot is studied based on a single impurity Anderson model using the numerical renormalization group (NRG). Specifically, we examine how the difference between the couplings {\^I}``L and {\^I}``R affects the ground state, which is known to show a quantum phase transition between a nonmagnetic singlet and a magnetic doublet depending on the various parameters; the Coulomb interaction U, onsite potential \epsilon_d, level width \Gamma_{\nu} caused by the hybridization, and superconducting (SC) gap \Delta_\mathrm{\nu} \equiv |\Delta_{\nu}|e^{i\theta_{\nu}} for the leads on the left and right ({\nu} = L,\,R). Our results show that whether the local moment is fully screened or not depends substantially on the asymmetry in the couplings \Gamma_L \neq \Gamma_R. It tends to make the singlet ground state stable, while the amplitude |\Delta_\mathrm{\nu}| and phase difference \phi\equiv \theta_R-\theta_L of the SC gaps tend to suppress the screening. We also discuss some general symmetry properties of the system and their relation to the current conservation.},

  Abstract                 = {Carbon nanotubes have been regarded since their discovery1 as potential molecular quantum wires. In the case of multi-wall nanotubes, where many tubes are arranged in a coaxial fashion, the electrical properties of individual tubes have been shown to vary strongly from tube to tube2,3, and to be characterized by disorder and localization4. Single-wall nanotubes5,6 (SWNTs) have recently been obtained with high yields and structural uniformity7. Particular varieties of these highly symmetric structures have been predicted to be metallic, with electrical conduction occurring through only two electronic modes8-10. Because of the structural symmetry and stiffness of SWNTs, their molecular wavefunctions may extend over the entire tube. Here we report electrical transport measurements on individual single-wall nanotubes that confirm these theoretical predictions. We find that SWNTs indeed act as genuine quantum wires. Electrical conduction seems to occur through well separated, discrete electron states that are quantum-mechanically coherent over long distance, that is at least from contact to contact (140nm). Data in a magnetic field indicate shifting of these states due to the Zeeman effect.},

This supercurrent is carried by Cooper pairs of electrons with a combined charge of twice the elementary charge, e. The 2e charge quantum is clearly visible in the height of voltage steps in Josephson junctions under microwave irradiation, and in the magnetic flux periodicity of h/2e (where h is Planck's constant) in superconducting quantum interference devices. Here we study supercurrents through a quantum dot created in a semiconductor nanowire by local electrostatic gating. Owing to strong Coulomb interaction, electrons only tunnel one-by-one through the discrete energy levels of the quantum dot. This nevertheless can yield a supercurrent when subsequent tunnel events are coherent. These quantum coherent tunnelling processes can result in either a positive or a negative supercurrent, that is, in a normal or a π-junction, respectively. We demonstrate that the supercurrent reverses sign by adding a single electron spin to the quantum dot. When excited states of the quantum dot are involved in transport, the supercurrent sign also depends on the character of the orbital wavefunctions.},

Different approximations are used and compared: the mean-field approximation, the second-order perturbation theory in the Coulomb interaction, and the exact diagonalization in the zero bandwidth limit. The system exhibits a rich behavior as a function of the relevant parameters. We discuss in detail the conditions for the observation of π junction behavior and the effect of Coulomb interactions on the Andreev states.},

  Abstract                 = {We show that one-dimensional quantum systems with gapless degrees of freedom and open boundary conditions form a universality class of quantum critical behavior, which we propose to call ``bounded Luttinger liquids.'' They share the following properties with ordinary (periodic) Luttinger liquids: the absence of fermionic quasiparticle excitations, charge-spin separation, and anomalous power-law correlations with exponents whose scaling relations are parametrized by a single coupling constant per degree of freedom, Kν. The values of Kν are independent of boundary conditions, but the representation of the critical exponents in terms of these Kν's depends on boundary conditions. We illustrate these scaling relations by exploring general rules for boundary critical exponents derived earlier using the Bethe ansatz solution of the one-dimensional Hubbard model together with boundary conformal field theory, and the theory of Luttinger liquids in finite-size systems. We apply this theory to the photoemission properties of the organic conductors (TMTSF)2X, where TMTSF is tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, and X=ClO9, PF6, ReO4, and discuss to what extent the assumption of finite strands with open boundaries at the sample surface can reconcile the experimental results with independent information on the Luttinger-liquid state in these materials.},

A Luttinger liquid with open boundaries is the effective low-energy theory of these models. As applications of the theory, the Friedel oscillations due to the boundaries and the tunneling conductance through a barrier are also calculated. The tunneling conductance is determined by a nonuniversal boundary exponent which governs its power law dependence on temperature and frequency.},

The underlying approximations are devised for weak to intermediate interactions and arbitrary coupling strengths, and have been checked by comparing with exact results in the atomic limit. We present results for the Andreev bound states as a function of the different system parameters, focusing on the molecular regime of large tunnel couplings $t$ for the double-dot. By applying a Zeeman field $B$ the energy difference of singlet, doublet and triplet spin configurations is tuned. The high flexibility in the implementation and the reduced numerical effort allows to explore the whole parameter space and to analyze the effects of 0-$\pi$ and singlet-triplet quantum phase transitions on the bound states.},

We provide benchmarks against the exact large-gap solution as well as renormalization group (NRG) calculations and find good quantitative agreement in the range of validity. The large flexibility of the implemented approaches then allows us to analyze a sizable parameter space, allowing us to get a deeper physical understanding into the Zeeman field, electrostatic gate, and flux dependence of Andreev levels in interacting nanostructures.},

From the numerical calculation, we find that the renormalized couplings between the leads and the dot in the equilibrium states characterize the peak formation in the nonequilibrium differential conductance. In particular, in the Kondo regime, the enhancement of the Andreev transport via a Kondo resonance occurs in the differential conductance at a finite bias voltage, leading to an anomalous peak whose position is given by the renormalized parameters. In addition to the peak, we show that the energy levels of the Andreev bound states give rise to other peaks in the differential conductance in the strongly correlated N-QD-S system. All these features of the nonequilibrium transport are consistent with those in the recent experimental results [Deacon , Phys. Rev. Lett.

  Abstract                 = {We present a numerical solution of the parquet approximation, a conserving diagrammatic approach which is self-consistent at both the single-particle and the two-particle levels. The fully irreducible vertex is approximated by the bare interaction thus producing the simplest approximation that one can perform with the set of equations involved in the formalism. The method is applied to the Hubbard model on a half-filled 4×4 cluster. Results are compared to those obtained from determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), FLuctuation EXchange (FLEX), and self-consistent second-order approximation methods. This comparison shows a satisfactory agreement with DQMC and a significant improvement over the FLEX or the self-consistent second-order approximation.},

  Abstract                 = {We have designed a multiscale approach for strongly correlated systems by combining the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) and the recently introduced dual fermion formalism. This approach employs an exact mapping from a real lattice to a DCA cluster of linear size Lc embedded in a dual fermion lattice. Short-length-scale physics is addressed by the DCA cluster calculation, while longer-length-scale physics is addressed diagrammatically using dual fermions. The bare and dressed dual fermionic Green functions scale as O(1/Lc), so perturbation theory on the dual lattice converges very quickly, e.g., the dual Fermion self-energy calculated with simple second-order perturbation theory is of order O(1/Lc3) with third-order and three-body corrections down by an additional factor of O(1/Lc).},

In our approach the low-temperature I-V characteristics can be calculated including all multiple quasiparticle and Andreev processes. The limit of very weak coupling to the leads and large charging energies is briefly analyzed comparing the calculated line shapes of the I-V curves with recent experimental results. When the coupling to the leads increases and Coulomb blockade effects can be neglected, the combination of multiple Andreev processes and resonant transmission gives rise to a rich subgap structure which largely differs from the one found in the more studied S-N-S systems. We concentrate on this regime showing how multiple processes can be included within a simple sequential tunneling picture qualitatively explaining the subgap structure. We suggest an experimental setup where the predicted effects could be observed.},

The dc Josephson current is evaluated from the Andreev levels. In the absence of SO interaction, a 0-π transition due to the magnetic field is clearly observed. In the presence of SO interaction, the coexistence of SO interaction and Zeeman effect results in En(-φ)≠En(φ), where the anomalous Josephson current flows even at φ =0.

On theother hand, in the case of the asymmetric Anderson model, we show howthe bound state induced by the magnetic impurity disappears when theimpurity is gradually transformed from (1) into (2) with an increaseof the energy of the impurity level.We also clarify the region where competition between the Kondo effectand superconductivity dominates the properties of the ground and thelocalized excited states in the parameter space of the Anderson model.In this region, we show that the bound state energy is scaled well by the single parameter T K/{\^I}'' (T K: Kondotemperature, {\^I}'': superconducting order parameter) as in the caseof the antiferromagnetic s-d interaction in superconductivity.},

  Abstract                 = {The Nagaoka Green's functions equations for a superconductor are solved exactly and the question of bound states within the gap is answered unambiguously. It is shown that there are always two bound states symmetrically located with respect to the center of the gap. For ferromagnetic coupling, γ>0, and for antiferromagnetic coupling, but T K ≫ T c0 or T K ≪ T c0, these bound states are very close to the gap edges. For T K ˜ T c 0, however, the bound states move towards the center of the gap. It is pointed out that in the latter case important deviations from the Abrikosov-Gorkov theory, i.e. manifestations of the Kondo effect, should occur which could be tested experimentally by investigating the density of states.},
